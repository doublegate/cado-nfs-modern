# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
loosely follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

This is a downstream **modernization + performance fork** of upstream
[CADO-NFS](https://gitlab.inria.fr/cado-nfs/cado-nfs). The `3.0.x-modern` line is
rebased onto upstream **3.0.0**; only the changes introduced by this fork are
listed. For the upstream history see [`NEWS`](NEWS). The earlier `2.3.1-modern`
release (rebased on upstream 2.3.0) is preserved under the `v2.3.1-modern` tag;
`main` tracks the latest release (`3.2.0-modern`); the **`3.3.0-modern` cycle is
in progress** (section directly below).

## [3.3.0-modern] — unreleased (in progress)

The cycle after `3.2.0-modern`, opened on an honest premise the fork has now
confirmed three times over: **on the reference hardware (i9-10850K, Comet Lake —
AVX2 but no AVX-512; a single RTX 3090) single-machine NFS *speed* is essentially
tapped out.** CPU tuning is saturated; GPU cofactorization is Amdahl-capped (~8 %
of sieve → <1 % net); GPU lattice sieving is a measured negative; the AVX-512
B-series is bit-exact under SDE but silicon-gated; multi-GPU/multi-node are
correctness-validated only at the degenerate path. An internet survey (upstream
CADO, msieve, YAFU, GGNFS, FLINT, GMP-ECM/CGBN, the RSA-250/DLP-240 record papers,
2021–2026 eprint/arxiv) confirms no published technique since ~2010 yields a >5 %
single-machine speedup, and that this fork is already ahead of public
implementations on GPU + SIMD modernization.

So `3.3.0-modern` splits its effort, deliberately and transparently, into two
parts: **(1) a shippable, *measurable* operator-experience core** that runs and
helps on this box today, and **(2) an honestly-gated experimental/research track**
(explicitly requested) attempted under the standing gate (`product == N` /
bit-exact / Intel SDE) and **documented even when the outcome is a wash or a
HW-gated design.** Same ethos as ever: no NFS-math changes; honest negatives
recorded, not hidden.

**Planned headline (shippable, measured-on-silicon):** a live TUI dashboard with
per-phase ETA; a `--doctor` preflight; shell completions + man pages;
checkpoint/resume clarity; Slurm/PBS integration; the fork's **first AVX2 SIMD
kernel that actually runs on this CPU** (a batched modular inverse — B-series
without the SDE asterisk); and **Galois-automorphism auto-detection** (a genuine,
measurable algorithmic win when the polynomial admits an automorphism).
**Research track (gated, honest):** GPU polyselect stage-2 root-sieve (a win only
at large N), GPU GF(p) lingen NTT (multi-GPU/DLP), IFMA→`arith-modp` wiring
(DLP, HW-gated), and an exTNFS/Tower-NFS feasibility skeleton.

- **Version bumped to `3.3.0-modern`** (`CMakeLists.txt` `CADO_VERSION_MINOR
  2 → 3`); roadmap [`docs/ROADMAP-v3.3.0-modern.md`](docs/ROADMAP-v3.3.0-modern.md);
  README/CLAUDE/BENCHMARKS updated; the §7 numbers measured 2026-06-07.

### Usability / utility / help (Track E) — the shippable, measurable core

- **E4 — live dashboard + ETA.** `cado-nfs-monitor-rs` gains a trailing-window
  **ETA (trend)** + **throughput** (work-units/min) computed from its own poll
  history, plus local **host CPU** (`/proc/stat`) and **GPU** (`nvidia-smi`)
  utilisation. The dependency-free `/dashboard` HTML (Flask + Rust servers) mirrors
  the trend-ETA + throughput browser-side. See `docs/usability-v330.md`.
- **E5 — `--doctor` preflight.** `cado-nfs.py --doctor [N]` (+ `--doctor-json`):
  a side-effect-free check of the build, CPU/SIMD, GPU, RAM/disk, Python env and
  schedulers vs the resource estimate for `N`, with a GO / NO-GO verdict
  (`scripts/cadofactor/doctor.py`, doctested).
- **E6 — shell completions + man page.** bash/zsh/fish completions generated from
  the argparse spec (`scripts/build-completions.py` → `misc/completions/`), a
  `--completions <shell>` flag on all three Rust binaries (`clap_complete`), and a
  `misc/man/cado-nfs.1` man page; CMake installs all of them.
- **E7 — checkpoint/resume clarity.** Documented what is resumable per phase, and
  surfaced the BWC krylov checkpoint cadence as a first-class
  **`--checkpoint-interval`** knob (`tasks.linalg.bwc.interval`).
- **E8 — Slurm/PBS integration.** A PBS/Torque `qsub` job-array path in
  `scripts/cluster-launch.sh` beside the existing Slurm `--sbatch` (shared
  `array_body` helper), plus **`--suggest-slurm-config` / `--suggest-pbs-config`**
  that emit a submission script sized to `N` from the planner estimate.

### Number-field math (Track A)

- **A5 — Galois automorphism auto-detect (measurable win).** A new exact detector
  (`scripts/cadofactor/galois.py`) finds whether the algebraic polynomial admits a
  CADO automorphism (`autom2.1/2.2/3.1/3.2/4.1/6.1`) via Möbius-invariance in
  integer arithmetic (with the `deg % order == 0` orbit guard), exposed as
  **`cado-nfs.py --galois-detect POLYFILE`**. Cross-validated against CADO's own
  `tests/sieve/galois.poly` fixture (`autom2.2`) and a cyclic cubic (`autom3.1`);
  correct no-op on generic GNFS polynomials. Detection only (advisory) — the
  matrix/sieve reduction is CADO's existing, upstream-validated `--galois` feature.
  See `docs/galois-auto-a5.md`.
- **A6 — exTNFS/Tower-NFS feasibility skeleton.** Extended the A4 study with
  concrete interface sketches (tower polyselect, the (2η)-D special-q siever shape,
  tower-ideal relation bookkeeping) — documented design, no committed tower math.
  See `docs/extnfs-a4.md`.

### SIMD (Track B)

- **B4 — AVX2 batched modular inverse (first measured-on-silicon SIMD).** An AVX2
  8-way masked binary-GCD modular inverse (`bench/avx2-modinv.c`), the per-prime
  siever-lattice slice, ported from the SDE-only AVX-512 B1 kernel using
  blend-based masking. Because it runs **natively** on this Comet Lake box it
  yields the fork's first *measured* batched-modinv result: **~4.6× scalar,
  bit-exact vs GMP (0/320000)**. Honest: Amdahl-bounded in the full siever (the
  byte-scatter majority stays scalar). See `docs/avx2-simd-b4.md`.
- **B5 — IFMA GF(p) → arith-modp routing bridge.** Extended `bench/ifma-gfp.c` with
  the complete DLP routing arithmetic — radix-2^64 (arith-modp storage) ↔
  radix-2^52 (IFMA) repack + the `vec_add_dotprod` `+w` addend — **bit-exact under
  SDE (0/32000)**. Honest: HW-gated (no IFMA silicon here) *and* repack-sensitive at
  p4/p5 width; the in-tree arith-modp specialization is the documented follow-up,
  not committed. See `docs/ifma-gfp-b3.md`.

### GPU (Track C)

- **C5 — GPU polyselect stage-2 root-sieve.** `bench/gpu-ropt-stage2.cu` models the
  root-sieve core (`rootsieve_run_line`) as an int32-accumulate scatter,
  **bit-exact vs the int16 CPU reference (0 wrong)** over a 4 M-cell line;
  ~1.7× on the raw apply step but an honest **wash** at testable sizes (real `ropt`
  sieves small per-rotation arrays — PCIe/launch-bound), the win being large-N only.
  See `docs/gpu-polyselect-ropt-c5.md`.
- **C6 — GPU GF(p) lingen NTT.** `bench/gpu-lingen-ntt.cu`: an iterative
  Cooley–Tukey NTT polynomial multiply over a 31-bit NTT prime, **bit-exact vs
  schoolbook (0/1199)**, ~0.5 ms for degree-2^16 (NTT size 2^17). Honest: the
  single-prime inner transform of a multi-modular GF(p) lingen, and lingen is
  ~3–8 % of BWC, so <1 % single-machine net — a multi-GPU/cluster-DLP play. See
  `docs/gpu-lingen-ntt-c6.md`.

### Honest findings (recorded, not hidden)

- Single-machine NFS *speed* is essentially tapped out on this hardware; the
  measurable v3.3.0 wins are the operator experience (Track E), the **AVX2 modinv**
  (B4, real silicon), and **Galois detection** (A5). C5/C6/B5 are research/HW-gated,
  documented with measured kernels but honest non-wins on one desktop.

## [3.2.0-modern] — 2026-06-07

The cycle after `3.1.0-modern`, grounded in the strategic reframe that **sieving
(~91 % of an RSA-250-scale run's cost) and polynomial selection** — not linear
algebra (~9 %) — are where the leverage is ([`docs/ROADMAP-v3.2.0-modern.md`](docs/ROADMAP-v3.2.0-modern.md)).
Same ethos throughout: every shipped change gated on `product == N`, a bit-exact
check, or Intel-SDE validation; HW-blocked work ships as documented designs or
correctness-validated kernels; **honest negatives and "already optimal upstream"
findings recorded, not hidden.**

**Headline (measured wins):** a validated GPU twisted-Edwards **mixed-representation
ECM** (~1.5–2.9× the Montgomery ladder, bit-exact); an **adaptive sub-warp GPU
SpMV** (1.3–1.8× cache-resident); **GPU polynomial-selection collision offload**;
**AVX-512** VPCLMULQDQ `mul2/3/4` + IFMA GF(p) + a batched modular-inverse for the
siever (all SDE-validated); real **multi-GPU partition** with per-device streams
(`product == N` at `NPART=2`, c90); **cluster sieving orchestration** (Slurm job
arrays + GPU-aware placement); and a **factor planner + per-host autotuner**.
**Honest findings:** the parallel merge and CPU mixed-rep ECM are already the
upstream RSA-record code; exTNFS-DLP is research-grade; GPU lattice sieving is a
measured negative. Full per-track detail below.

- **Version bumped to `3.2.0-modern`** (`CMakeLists.txt` `CADO_VERSION_MINOR
  1 → 2`); roadmap added; README/CLAUDE/BENCHMARKS updated; the §6 GPU/SIMD
  additions re-measured 2026-06-07 (`BENCHMARKS.md`).

### GPU (C1) — adaptive SpMV kernel (sub-warp CSR-vector)

- **Faster GPU SpMV in the cache-resident regime.** The 3.1.0 warp-per-row kernel
  uses a full 32-lane warp per output row, but BWC rows have only ~30 nonzeros, so
  each lane does ~1 gather then a 5-step warp-reduce — reduce-bound. A new sub-warp
  **CSR-vector** kernel (`spmv_vec<K,VEC>`, VEC=16) puts two rows per warp, halving
  the reduce and raising occupancy. `launch_spmv` now **dispatches adaptively**:
  vec16 when the source vector is L2-resident (`nrows·K·8 ≤ 12 MB`), else the
  latency-hiding warp32 kernel (override with `CADO_GPU_SPMV={vec,warp}`).
- **Measured (RTX 3090, `bench/gpu-spmv-bench.cu`, bit-exact at every size):** in
  the cache-resident regime vec16 is **1.26–1.8× warp** (e.g. 49.5 vs 39.4 Gnz/s
  at 0.8 M rows; up to ~27 vs ~15 at 1 M); at large N (≥ ~2 M rows / wider blocks)
  it is a wash or worse, so the adaptive dispatch keeps warp32 there — **no
  regression**. End-to-end `product == N` on the c59 with both the adaptive (→vec)
  default and a forced `CADO_GPU_SPMV=warp` run.
- **Column reordering for the large-N gather — investigated and rejected
  (honest negative).** Measured the locality headroom directly (8 M rows, RTX
  3090): random columns 8.1 Gnz/s, a loose band only **1.1×**, a tight band 1.7×,
  within-row sorting **~2 %**. NFS matrices' skewed degree distribution (dense
  small-prime columns) can't be packed into tight bands, so the realistic gain
  (~1.1×) doesn't justify a global symmetric reorder + the consistent `mmt_vec`
  permutation it would need in the validated matmul layer (and CADO balancing
  already reorders). The large-N SpMV is gather-latency-bound; the better levers
  are the adaptive vec kernel, residency, and multi-GPU (`docs/gpu-linalg.md`).

### GPU (C2) — polynomial selection (profile + foundation kernel)

- **Profiled CADO polyselect stage-1** (the GPU target per the v3.2.0 reframe;
  proven GPU-friendly in msieve since 2009, absent in CADO). `perf` puts the hot
  self-time in **per-prime modular root finding** — `modredcul_intinv` (16 %, the
  modular inverse), `modul_poly_div_r`/`xpowmod` (root finding of `f mod p`,
  ~11 %), plus `L2_skewness`/`double_poly_compute_roots` (size scoring, ~15 %) and
  the collision hash (~10 %). Root finding over thousands of independent primes is
  the GPU sweet spot.
- **Foundation kernels, bit-exact:**
  - *modular inverse* (`bench/gpu-polyselect-modinv.cu`): GPU batched single-word
    modular inverse (the 16 % hottest leaf), bit-exact vs GMP over 200 000 (a, p)
    pairs (0 wrong; 469 M inv/s on an RTX 3090).
  - *per-prime root finding* (`bench/gpu-polyselect-roots.cu`): roots of a degree-d
    polynomial mod a batch of primes, one thread/prime by direct Horner evaluation
    over F_p — exactly correct by construction, validated bit-exact vs a CPU
    reference + a self-check (f(r) ≡ 0): 0 mismatch over 5133 primes (deg 6),
    **GPU 45.9 ms vs CPU 20-thread 277.6 ms = 6.0×**. Direct eval is O(p), a win
    only in the small-prime regime.
  - *gcd-based root finding* (`bench/gpu-polyselect-roots-gcd.cu`): the
    asymptotically-better, p-magnitude-independent method — `h = x^p mod f` by
    binary exponentiation (poly multiply mod f), `g = gcd(h − x, f)`, then
    Cantor–Zassenhaus split into linear factors, all over F_p reusing the validated
    modular arithmetic (`__host__ __device__`, identical GPU/CPU code). Validated
    **bit-exact vs direct-eval** (full root multiset): 0 mismatch / 0 self-check-bad
    over 3245 primes (deg 6, p < 30 000); and **5000 primes near 10⁹ in 27.8 ms**
    (0 self-check-bad) where direct-eval's O(p) is infeasible. The production
    root-finder for the full prime range.
- **Collision-search integration — exact target validated + designed.** CADO's
  per-prime step is `roots_mod_uint64(Ñ mod p, d, p)` = solve `x^d ≡ Ñ mod p` (the
  d-th roots, not an arbitrary polynomial). Re-validated the gcd kernel on that
  exact case (`f = x^d − a`): 0 mismatch / 0 self-check-bad over 3245 primes
  (p < 30 000) + 5000 near 10⁹, so its root set matches `roots_mod_uint64` across
  the full range. `docs/gpu-polyselect.md` now specifies the precise wiring: batch
  `(p, Ñ mod p)` → one GPU launch → `roots_lift` (CPU) + `polyselect_proots_add`,
  leaving the `shash` collision search byte-identical; a `polyselect-gpu.cu` under
  `-DENABLE_GPU=ON` reached via the `matmul-gpu-hooks` pattern; `--gpu-polyselect`
  (default off) gated on matching Murphy-E + `product == N`. The full live wiring
  into the multithreaded proots subtask is the remaining (large) step, scoped
  honestly; the kernels and the exact target are validated.
- **Design + plan** in `docs/gpu-polyselect.md`: the batched per-prime
  root-finding kernel (`gcd(x^p − x, f) mod p`, reusing the validated modinv) →
  feed the `shash` collision search → GPU size scoring → a `--gpu-polyselect`
  flag, gated on matching polynomial quality (Murphy-E) + an end-to-end
  `product == N`. The full module lands incrementally; this is the foundation.

### GPU (C2) — live `--gpu-polyselect` wiring (DONE; correct, gated, honest negative)

- **Full live integration shipped behind a default-off flag.** The validated
  gcd + Cantor–Zassenhaus root-finder is now wired into CADO's real polyselect:
  - `polyselect/polyselect-gpu.cu` — device backend; one thread per prime builds
    `f = x^d − a_i` and solves it mod `p_i`, the host entry batches a thread's
    whole prime range into **one launch** with **persistent per-thread device +
    pinned-host buffers** (no per-ad-value `cudaMalloc` churn).
  - `polyselect/polyselect-gpu-hooks.{h,cpp}` + `polyselect-gpu-stub.cpp` — the
    hook ABI (the `matmul-gpu-hooks` pattern): the `cado_gpu_polyselect_roots`
    pointer lives in `polyselect_common` (dependency-free leaf, no circular
    static-link), `cado_gpu_polyselect_init()` is defined in the `.cu` (GPU build)
    *or* the stub (CPU build) — exactly one is linked.
  - `polyselect/polyselect_proots.cpp` — the injection, gated on
    `CADO_GPU_POLYSELECT` + a non-null hook; gathers `(p_i, Ñ mod p_i)` for the
    thread's range, one device call, then per-prime `roots_lift` +
    `polyselect_proots_add` (byte-identical downstream). Falls back to the
    unchanged per-prime CPU loop on any failure / non-GPU build.
  - `cado-nfs.py --gpu-polyselect` (`toplevel.py`) — sets `CADO_GPU_POLYSELECT=1`
    for every spawned polyselect worker; documented as experimental.
- **Correctness gate — passed.** GPU vs CPU produce a **bit-identical polynomial
  set** (sorted-poly-line diff = 0) at three scales (198 / 136 / 7 kept polys;
  `d=4,5`, `P` up to 250000); device-absent → clean CPU fallback; the 32 ctest
  `polyselect` tests pass; **end-to-end `product == N`** on the 59-digit smoke with
  `--gpu-polyselect`.
- **Performance gate — honest negative.** Measured (i9-10850K + RTX 3090, `d=5`
  `P=50000` `admax=60000` `-t 4`): **CPU 3.2 s vs GPU 4.1 s** — a net slowdown.
  Two fundamental causes, not bugs: (1) **Amdahl** — root-finding is a minority of
  stage-1 (collision search + size-opt stay on CPU), capping the best case at
  ~1.5×; (2) CADO's CPU `roots_mod_uint64` is a *specialised d-th-root* algorithm,
  already so fast that there is no compute to amortise the kernel-launch + PCIe
  round-trip against. Mirrors the 3.0.0 GPU-cofactorization Amdahl finding. The
  win requires offloading the **collision search** (the bulk of stage-1) at much
  larger `N` — the documented next step, for which this validated root-finder and
  hook ABI are the foundation. Full analysis in `docs/gpu-polyselect.md`.

### GPU (C2) — live collision-search offload (DONE; correct, size-gated)

- **The collision search now runs on the GPU behind `--gpu-polyselect`.** A second
  hook (`cado_gpu_polyselect_collisions`, same leaf-TU ABI) installed by
  `polyselect-gpu.cu` runs the whole-range generate → `thrust::sort_by_key` → detect
  pipeline on the device (shared, mutex-serialized, persistent buffers) and returns
  the colliding `(u, p₁, p₂)`. Wired into the **computational** collision pass (`CCS`)
  in `polyselect_collisions.cpp`: one thread issues the device search over the full
  prime range and pushes the *same* `polyselect_match_info` jobs as the CPU `shash2`,
  so `match` and everything downstream are byte-identical. The cheap **decisional**
  pass (`DCS`, run per special-q) stays on CPU.
- **Size-gated, so no regression.** The GPU path engages only when the estimated
  u-count (`Σ nrᵢ·2·umax/pᵢ²`) clears ~4 M; below that the unchanged CPU `shash`
  runs. At the c59–c90 sizes testable here (a few thousand u) it is a no-op; it
  engages at large N where the collision search dominates stage-1. The measured-
  negative GPU root-finder was **split off** to a separate opt-in
  (`CADO_GPU_POLYSELECT_ROOTS`) so it no longer rides along with `--gpu-polyselect`.
  (`CADO_GPU_POLYSELECT_FORCE` overrides the gate for testing.)
- **Validated.** Forcing the gate on at c59 exercised the device path **203×, 0
  fallbacks**, polynomial set **byte-identical** to CPU (66 = 66); **end-to-end
  `product == N`** with GPU collisions forced; all 32 `polyselect` ctests pass on the
  default CPU path. Enabled-but-gated-off cost is a one-time ~4 s CUDA init (constant
  vs work size; negligible for a real run). The fixed bug worth noting: the per-prime
  offset scan over the `uint8_t` `nr` array must accumulate in 32-bit (an explicit
  `0u` init) — without it the scan overflows at 256, scrambling the expansion into a
  6.4-trillion-entry garbage workload (OOM / `ppl==0` infinite loop). Full design +
  results in `docs/gpu-polyselect.md`.

### GPU (C2) — collision-search offload, foundation kernel (the real win; bit-exact)

- **GPU collision search, validated bit-exact** (`bench/gpu-polyselect-collision.cu`).
  The collision search is the memory-bound *bulk* of polyselect stage-1 and the part
  that **grows with N** (so, unlike root-finding, no Amdahl ceiling). For each prime
  `p` with lifted root `r` CADO emits every `u ≡ r (mod p²)` in `[−umax, umax)` and a
  collision is two equal `u` from different primes. The GPU-friendly reformulation —
  **generate → `thrust::sort_by_key` → detect adjacent-equal**, with the whole
  `u`-multiset **resident on the device** (only the small `(p,r)` table in, only the
  few collisions out) — sidesteps the PCIe round-trip that sank the root-finding
  offload. Gate = bit-exact vs a CPU `std::sort` reference on **44.9 M `u`-values**
  (4459 primes in `[50000,100000]`, `umax = 2.5·10¹³`, 539 MB resident): **sorted
  multiset identical (0 mismatches)** and **collision set identical** (31 — 8
  injected + 23 natural birthday collisions). **GPU 40.3 ms vs CPU `std::sort`
  5270 ms (≈130×, 1.1 Gu/s).** Honest: the 130× is vs `std::sort`; CADO's `shash` is
  an O(n) hash (faster than `std::sort`), so the real in-situ speedup vs `shash` is
  smaller and will be measured during live integration (same discipline as the
  root-finder). What this proves: the entire collision multiset can be built, sorted
  and de-duplicated on the GPU, bit-exactly, with no PCIe traffic for the bulk data —
  the foundation for the msieve-style "stage-1 resident on the GPU" endgame. Design +
  the live-integration plan in `docs/gpu-polyselect.md`.

### Roadmap (A1) — 3-D lattice sieving re-scoped (honest correction)

- **A1 closed for the factorization track.** The roadmap listed 3-D lattice sieving
  (arXiv 2001.10860) as a locally-testable `c100` factorization win. Research showed
  this is a **misread**: that paper's 3-D/higher-D enumeration is for the **Tower NFS
  / extension-field discrete log** (its result is a 𝔽_{p⁶} DLP), where elements have
  degree ≥ 3; **integer-factorization relations are (a,b) pairs — inherently 2-D**,
  and CADO's siever is 2-D because of that, so the stated "seeded c100" gate is not
  achievable. Recorded as a negative (like PGO / column-reorder); any 3-D pursuit
  belongs under DLP/exTNFS (A4), not the factorization track. `docs/ROADMAP-v3.2.0-modern.md`
  updated.

### HPC orchestration (D3) — cluster sieving fan-out: sbatch job arrays + GPU-aware placement

- **Promoted `scripts/cluster-launch.sh` to a real distributed driver.** 3.1.0
  shipped SSH + interactive-`srun` client fan-out; D3 adds the two pieces a batch
  HPC cluster needs:
  - **Slurm `--sbatch` JOB ARRAY** mode: generates and submits an sbatch script
    (`--array=0-(nodes-1)`, one task per node, optional `--partition`/`--time`/
    `--gres=gpu:N`), each array task starting the per-node clients — for
    non-interactive batch clusters (vs the existing `--slurm` srun that holds an
    allocation). `--dry-run` prints the generated script instead of submitting.
  - **GPU-aware placement** `--gpus-per-node N`: starts **one client pinned per
    GPU** (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0..N-1`, unique `host.gpuJ` clientids) across SSH,
    `srun` (`--gpus-per-task=1`), and `sbatch` (`--gres`) — the right placement for
    GPU-prefactor / GPU-cofactor clients (one rank per GPU). All point at the same
    work-unit server URL + cert pinning, so sieving fans out through the Rust
    `cado-wu-server-rs` (or the Flask server) unchanged.
- **Validated locally** (the orchestration logic, all modes): `bash -n` clean; the
  generated sbatch script is itself valid bash (`bash -n`); GPU-aware SSH emits one
  `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`-pinned client per GPU per host; `srun` adds
  `--gpus-per-task=1`; plain SSH and `--stop` regressions preserved. The live
  multi-host fan-out needs a real cluster + the running work-unit server (the 3.1.0
  swap); the driver logic is exercised via `--dry-run`. See `docs/rust-orchestration.md`.

### GPU at scale (D2) — NVSHMEM/GPUDirect multi-node residency (HW-gated design)

- **Design for keeping BWC vectors device-resident across the MPI grid.** 3.1.0
  made vectors device-resident *within* a rank, but at multi-node scale the
  per-iteration cross-rank collectives — `MPI_Allgather` (broadcast,
  `matmul_top_comm.cpp:151`), `MPI_Reduce_scatter[_block]` (reduce, `:551–573`),
  `MPI_Allreduce` (dotprods, `:804`) — run on **host** buffers, forcing a
  device↔host round-trip every iteration. D2 documents the concrete fix:
  (L1) intra-node on-device reduce over NVLink via CUDA-aware MPI (device-pointer
  collectives, `MPIX_Query_cuda_support`-gated) or NVSHMEM; (L2) inter-node
  GPUDirect-RDMA boundary exchange over InfiniBand, reduced-per-node to minimize
  volume; (L3) overlap the boundary exchange with the SpMV (reusing D1's per-device
  stream chunks) — the only path to a multi-node GPU-BWC win per the 3.1.0 transfer
  accounting. A wiring table maps each collective to its device replacement.
- **Honest scope.** HW-gated (CUDA-aware MPI + GPUDirect RDMA + ≥2 GPUs/nodes —
  none on this box), so **no unvalidated NVSHMEM code committed**; the degenerate
  single-rank path is already the validated `CADO_GPU_VECRESIDENT` resident loop.
  Includes the on-real-HW validation plan (probe → device collectives → 2-rank c90
  `product == N` → measure overlap → ship with the number). See
  `docs/multinode-residency-d2.md`.

### GPU at scale (D1) — intra-node multi-GPU partition: per-device streams + real validation

- **Finished the `CADO_GPU_NPART` partition with per-device CUDA streams (the
  overlap 3.1.0 left as a TODO) and validated it end-to-end.** 3.1.0 shipped the
  matrix partition (slice each direction's CSR into `nparts` output-row chunks,
  round-robin over `cudaGetDeviceCount()` devices) but ran the chunks **sequentially**
  ("genuine multi-GPU overlap would use per-device streams — unverified"). D1 adds a
  `cudaStream_t` per chunk (created on its device) and makes `mul()` issue each
  chunk's **async H2D-src / SpMV / async D2H-dst on that stream**, then synchronizes
  all streams — so the chunks' copies+kernels overlap and, on ≥2 GPUs, the devices
  run **concurrently** (the chunks are independent: disjoint output rows, each
  reading the full src). `launch_spmv` is now stream-aware; `nparts=1` is the
  unchanged default-stream single-device path.
- **Validated `product == N` on a full c90 GNFS run** with
  `CADO_GPU_NPART=2 tasks.linalg.bwc.mm_impl=gpu` — both chunks land on this box's
  single GPU (round-robin, ndev=1), so the **split → per-stream async multi-launch →
  gather is bit-exact** and the streamed staging path is genuinely exercised; the
  two prime factors match the reference run. Cross-device *concurrency* still needs
  ≥2 physical GPUs (the per-device streams are the mechanism that delivers it).
- **Honest scope.** On one GPU the partition is correctness-overhead; the streamed
  structure is what makes it a throughput win on real multi-GPU. Pinned host staging
  (to fully overlap H2D/D2H with compute on pageable BWC vectors) is a further opt.
  See `docs/gpu-linalg.md` (Intra-node partition).

### Research (A4) — exTNFS / Tower-NFS DLP feasibility (documented, not committed)

- **Feasibility study for adding (extended) Tower NFS to the DLP side.** CADO does
  classic NFS-DLP for GF(p), GF(p²) (integrated, `-gfpext 2`), and GF(p^k) small k
  (manual polynomials), with a **2-D siever**. exTNFS (Kim–Barbulescu CRYPTO 2016;
  Kim–Jeong PKC 2017) is the asymptotically-best method for medium-characteristic
  GF(p^k) with composite k — but it sieves over a number-field **tower**, so
  relations are higher-degree (`a(ι)+b(ι)x`) and the siever is **≥3-D** (the A1
  paper, arXiv:2001.10860, is this — TNFS, not factorization; A4 is its home).
  Component gap analysis: tower polynomial selection + a new higher-dimensional
  siever + tower-ideal relation handling + tower individual-log — a research-grade,
  multi-component effort, outside the fork's GPU leverage. **Documented, no
  speculative tower math committed.** See `docs/extnfs-a4.md`.

### Research (C4) — GPU lattice sieving feasibility (measured negative)

- **Measured study: don't build a GPU NFS siever.** `bench/gpu-sieve-scatter.cu`
  benchmarks the core sieve op (random `S[off]+=v` scatter) GPU vs CPU (RTX 3090 /
  i9-10850K): in the cache-resident regime where bucket regions live, GPU atomic
  scatter is **~5.4×** a full CPU socket (the CPU all-core plateaus at ~1.4 G
  upd/s, bound by streaming the update arrays; the GPU edge is its HBM bandwidth).
  But that is only the apply step in isolation — the **byte-atomic granularity** (no
  8-bit GPU atomic; this probe used optimistic int cells), **on-GPU update
  generation** (the per-prime lattice arithmetic + bucket fill, ~half the siever),
  memory capacity, and pipeline integration are unsolved. Consistent with the
  literature: GPUs have done NFS **cofactorization** for a decade, but **no
  production GPU siever exists** ("GPU/tensor-core lattice sieving" is lattice
  reduction / SVP, a different problem). Verdict: keep GPU effort on
  cofactorization (A2), GPU linalg (C1/D1), and polyselect collisions (C2).
  Recorded as a measured negative. See `docs/gpu-sieving-c4.md`.

### CPU/SIMD (B1) — AVX-512 sieving: batched modular inverse (SDE-validated; honest scatter wall)

- **Vectorized the siever's one vectorizable hot slice; confirmed the rest is a
  scatter wall.** The c120 profile (3.1.0) puts siever self-time in `fill_in_buckets`
  (~12%, scatter), `plattice_info` (~11%, modular arith), `sieve_small_bucket_region`
  (~10%, byte scatter), `invmod_redc_32` (~9.5%, modular inverse), `apply_buckets_inner`
  (~7%, scatter). **AVX-512 does not rescue the scatter loops**: the sieve array is
  `uint8` and AVX-512 scatter is 32/64-bit-element only (no 8-bit scatter), so the
  ~29% byte-scatter majority stays scalar — extending the 3.1.0 "AVX2-on-siever
  ruled out" finding to AVX-512 (now with the precise reason).
- **`bench/avx512-modinv.c`** implements `modinv16`: an **AVX-512 16-way batched
  32-bit modular inverse** — the vectorizable arithmetic core of the per-prime
  lattice setup (`invmod_redc_32` + `plattice_info`). `invmod_redc_32` is a
  binary-GCD inverse mod p with a *different modulus per prime*, so Montgomery's
  batch-inversion trick doesn't apply; instead 16 independent inverses run as a
  **masked per-lane state machine** (`_mm512_mask_*`, looping until all lanes done)
  — the published AVX-512 sieve-index angle (SECRYPT 2021), distinct from the
  ruled-out AVX2 path. Computes the plain `a⁻¹ mod b` (the REDC `2⁻³²` fixup folds
  in at integration); `b < 2³¹`.
- **Validated bit-exact vs GMP under Intel SDE** (`bench/avx512-modinv-validate.sh`
  + the `avx512-validate` CI): **PASS, 0 wrong / 640 000 trials**.
- **Honest scope.** Done + validated: the batched modular inverse. Confirmed
  un-vectorizable: the ~29% byte-scatter majority (hard memory wall). Remaining
  (integration): batch 16 primes' `plattice_info` setups through `modinv16` (REDC
  fixup + `b≥2³¹` scalar tail) — the invasive restructuring 3.1.0 flagged; net
  siever speedup is Amdahl-bounded by the scatter majority and gated on real
  AVX-512 silicon. See `docs/avx512-sieving-b1.md`.

### CPU/SIMD (B3) — AVX-512 IFMA GF(p) for the BWC backend (plain-rep, SDE-validated)

- **Wired the v3.1.0 IFMA modmul toward CADO's GF(p) backend.** "mpfq" is now the
  C++ `arith-modp` (`linalg/bwc/arith-modp*.hpp`, the `p1`…`p8` DLP BWC fields).
  Reading it settled the integration: (1) `arith-modp` stores elements **plain**
  (`[0,p)`, schoolbook mul + Barrett reduce) — *not* Montgomery, so the validated
  Montgomery IFMA kernel can't drop in as-is; (2) the batched full-modmul sites are
  `arith-generic.hpp`'s `vec_add_dotprod` / `vec_addmul_and_reduce` (the scalar
  `mul` wastes 7/8 lanes; SpMV is multiply-by-small-coefficient).
- **`bench/ifma-gfp.c`** builds the missing **plain-representation** batched
  primitives on the validated Montgomery kernel with no per-element domain churn,
  via `M(x,y)=x·y·R^{-1}`: `plain_mul(a,b)=M(M(a,b),R²)=a·b mod p` (two montmuls),
  and `dotprod=Σ M(aᵢ,bᵢ)` then one final `M(·,R²)` — the common `R^{-1}`
  amortizes (n montmuls + 1, not 2n; the `vec_add_dotprod` shape). Plain-in/out,
  8-way (one GF(p) field per lane).
- **Validated bit-exact vs GMP under Intel SDE** (wired into `bench/ifma-validate.sh`
  + the `avx512-validate` CI): `plain_mul` and `dotprod` **PASS, 0/32000** at
  260-bit (`p4`/`p5`). `mpz_mul; mpz_mod` *is* `arith-modp`'s `mul` semantics, so
  this proves the IFMA path computes the backend's GF(p) ops in its plain
  representation.
- **Honest scope.** The representation-compatible primitive is done + validated;
  the remaining `arith-modp` change (route `vec_add_dotprod`/`vec_addmul_and_reduce`
  for `p4`/`p5` through IFMA — 64↔52-bit limb repack at the vector boundary, `R²`
  per field, the 8-lane block map) is DLP-only, and the speedup is gated on real
  AVX-512-IFMA silicon (`plain_mul` pays 2 montmuls/result; the win concentrates in
  dotprod/addmul). See `docs/ifma-gfp-b3.md`.

### CPU/SIMD (B2) — AVX-512 VPCLMULQDQ gf2x mul2/mul3/mul4 (SDE-validated)

- **Ported the fixed small gf2x Karatsuba kernels `gf2x_mul2` / `mul3` / `mul4` to
  AVX-512 VPCLMULQDQ.** 3.1.0 shipped the hot variable-length `mul_1_n` (`mul1.h`)
  + configure detection; `mul2`–`mul9` were PCLMUL copies. Each port packs its
  independent Karatsuba base products into the 128-bit lanes of a 512-bit
  `_mm512_clmulepi64_epi128` (imm 0x00 = lane.a.lo·lane.b.lo) and folds scalar-side:
  **mul2** 3 products in 1 clmul, **mul3** 6 in 2, **mul4** 3×mul2. Implemented with
  **AVX-512F + VPCLMULQDQ only** (the flags the vpclmul backend already adds — the
  store-and-read style of `mul1.h`, no AVX-512DQ/VL), in
  `gf2x/already_tuned/x86_64_vpclmul/gf2x_mul{2,3,4}.h`, guarded by
  `GF2X_HAVE_VPCLMUL_SUPPORT` with the proven PCLMUL code kept as the `#else`
  fallback.
- **Validated bit-exact under Intel SDE** (`bench/vpclmul-muln.c`, wired into
  `bench/vpclmul-validate.sh` + the `avx512-validate.yml` CI): 200 000 random trials
  vs an independent scalar GF(2)[x] reference — **mul2/mul3/mul4 PASS, 0 wrong** at
  128/192/256-bit. Additionally validated by compiling the *integrated headers
  themselves* with `GF2X_HAVE_VPCLMUL_SUPPORT` (PASS, 0 wrong), and the PCLMUL
  `#else` fallback re-verified to still compile + pass.
- **Honest scope (correctness-only here; perf CI-gated).** Comet Lake has no
  AVX-512, so this is SDE-validated; the speedup is gated on real AVX-512 silicon.
  For these *fixed tiny* sizes the win is modest (a few clmuls fused vs the cost of
  assembling the operand zmm) — the dominant Drucker–Gueron gain is the
  variable-length `mul_1_n` already shipped. The Toom kernels `mul5`–`mul9` remain
  PCLMUL fallbacks (correct; harder lane mapping). Threshold retune + `lingen`
  perf need AVX-512 hardware. See `gf2x/already_tuned/x86_64_vpclmul/INTEGRATION.md`.

### GPU (C3) — batch-smoothness leaf extraction (validated, reuses A2; honest scope)

- **The A2-reusable part of GPU batch smoothness, done and validated.** CADO's
  `sieve/ecm/batch.cpp` is Bernstein batch smoothness (Alg. 7.1): a product tree +
  remainder tree giving `P mod R[j]` (P = ∏ primes ≤ 2^lpb), then per-leaf
  smooth-part extraction. The **trees are big-integer (CPU/GMP)**; the **leaf
  extraction fans out to n bounded-width cofactors** and is the only part that
  fits the fixed-K-limb Montgomery arithmetic from the GPU ECM (A2).
- **`bench/gpu-batch-smooth.cu`** implements the leaf stage by Bernstein's powering
  variant — `s = gcd(R, (P mod R)^(2^e) mod R)` — reusing the A2 `montmul` for the
  `e` modular squarings (no big-integer division; and since `gcd(R, y·2^{64K}) =
  gcd(R, y)` for odd R, the gcd runs directly on the Montgomery-form result).
  **Validated bit-exact vs an independent GMP ground truth** — both the smooth part
  and the smooth/rough classification: **PASS, 0/8192 at 128/256/512-bit**.
  Throughput 20.6 / 1.45 / 1.60 Mleaf/s; 7/8/9 Montgomery squarings + gcd per leaf.
- **Honest scope.** The leaf stage is cheap by design (~0.05–0.7 µs/leaf); the
  batch-smoothness bottleneck is the **big-integer remainder tree**, which is
  arbitrary-precision and stays on CPU/GMP — *not* expressible in A2's fixed-width
  arithmetic. A full GPU batch-smoothness path would need the product/remainder
  trees ported to GPU big-integer multiply/division (a separate, substantial
  effort; documented design, not committed unvalidated). For GPU cofactorization
  overall, **ECM (A2) remains the better single-machine fit** (fixed-width, no
  trees; just made ~1.5–2.9× faster). See `docs/gpu-batch-smooth-c3.md`.

### Algorithm (A3) — parallel structured Gaussian elimination (merge): already upstream (verified)

- **A3 is already implemented upstream (honest finding).** `filter/merge.cpp` *is*
  parallel structured Gaussian elimination — its header cites the exact roadmap
  reference (Bouillaguet–Zimmermann, *Parallel Structured Gaussian Elimination for
  the NFS*, Mathematical Cryptology 0(1), 2020) + the Davis–Duff–Nakov parallel
  Markowitz threshold, implemented with ~50 OpenMP pragmas. It is the RSA-240/250
  merge. The orchestration already runs it with **all logical threads**
  (`tasks.filter.merge.threads` inherits `tasks.threads`; `bwc.threads` is the one
  held to physical cores — toplevel doctest asserts merge=32 vs bwc=16 on a
  16C/32T host). Nothing to add — recorded like A2's CPU path and the 3.1.0
  PGO/micro-opt negatives.
- **Verified it actually parallelizes (measured).** `filter/merge` wall-clock vs
  `-t` on real purged matrices (i9-10850K): **c60** (20 K rows) 0.34→0.10 s =
  **3.4× @ t8**; **c90** (303 K rows) 7.27→2.20 s = **3.3× @ t8**, then plateaus
  and slightly regresses at 16–20. Honest: desktop-scale matrices saturate the
  parallelism at ~8 threads (the B–Z scaling targets RSA-scale, tens of millions
  of rows); but it still cuts merge wall ~3.3× and is on by default. See
  `docs/parallel-merge-a3.md`.

### Algorithm (A2) — mixed-representation ECM: CPU already done; new validated GPU win

- **CPU `facul` ECM already implements A2 (honest finding).** The Bouvier–Imbert
  2020 mixed-representation scheme (twisted-Edwards stage-1 + switch-to-Montgomery,
  "−4 M") is already in upstream as the **"mishmash"** bytecode
  (`sieve/ecm/bytecode_mishmash_B1_data.h`, `ec_arith_cost.h`'s
  `EDWARDS_ADDmontgomery 4.`, `ec_arith_{Edwards,Montgomery}.h` + `bytecode.c`) —
  the paper's authors are CADO authors. Nothing to add on the CPU path; recorded
  like the other "already optimal" findings.
- **GPU ECM: new twisted-Edwards `a=−1` mixed-rep stage-1, validated bit-exact,
  measurably faster than the Montgomery ladder.** The fork's GPU ECM
  (`bench/gpu-ecm-mp.cu`, `sieve/ecm/gpu_ecm.cu`, the `--gpu-prefactor` engine)
  used a pure Montgomery XZ ladder (~11 modmuls/scalar-bit). Whether Edwards wins
  *on GPU* was uncertain (extended coords = 4 field elements/point vs 2, plus a
  per-thread wNAF table — and GPU ECM occupancy is register/limb bound), so it was
  **measured, not assumed**.
- **`bench/gpu-ecm-edwards.cu`** implements `a=−1` extended-coordinate `edbl`
  (8 mm) and `eadd` (9 mm) using the exact **EFD / HWCD-2008** formulas (verified
  against the Explicit-Formulas Database), with stage-1 by plain double-and-add
  and by **wNAF(w=4)** (digits recoded once on the host since `s` is shared across
  the batch → zero warp divergence, like the CPU mishmash). Correctness gate:
  bit-exact `x([s]P)` vs the ladder through the **Montgomery↔twisted-Edwards
  birational map** (BBJLP-2008; no square roots — pick `(u0,v0)`, derive `d`),
  checked host and device — **PASS, 0/8192 lanes wrong at 128/256/512-bit**.
- **Measured (RTX 3090, vs the single-scalar Montgomery ladder, B1=2000):** wNAF
  Edwards is **~1.5–1.8× (128-bit), ~1.4–2.2× (256-bit), ~2.3–2.9× (512-bit)** —
  the win grows with modulus width; plain double-and-add is ≈ break-even (theory:
  ~12.5 vs 11 mm/bit). The feared extended-coordinate occupancy penalty did not
  dominate at `w=4`. This is the **validated foundation + measured win** (same
  staging as the C2 collision-search work); wiring it into the live
  `gpu_ecm`/`gpu_prefactor` engines (with dedicated tripling + the final
  Edwards→Montgomery switch for stage-2, and feeding **C3**) is the next step. See
  `docs/gpu-ecm-mixedrep.md`.

### Orchestration/UX (E2/E3) — factor planner + per-host autotuner (DONE)

- **`--plan` / `--plan-json` (E3, the "factor planner").** Given `N` and the
  host's thread count, `cado-nfs.py --plan` prints a feasibility verdict, a
  **wall-time envelope** (central + ±20 % NFS-variance band), the rough per-phase
  split, a single-machine-vs-cluster recommendation, and **GPU triage**
  (`--gpu-prefactor` first; GPU BWC linalg at large N) — then exits without
  running anything. The model is anchored on the **measured** `BENCHMARKS.md`
  numbers (c60 18.5 s, c70 27.2 s, c80 74.4 s, c90 197.9 s on the i9-10850K at 20
  threads) plus the documented order-of-magnitude envelope (c100 ~10 min, c110
  ~1 hr), interpolated log-linearly in digit count and Amdahl-scaled to the host's
  thread count (parallel fraction 0.7). It reproduces the c90 anchor to the second
  (3.3 min) and scales correctly with `-t` (55.8 s at c70/-t 8 vs 27 s at -t 20).
  `--host-speed FACTOR` lets a user fold in a measured per-core speed; `<60` digits
  is flagged TOO SMALL (use ECM/P±1), `≥130` flags distributed mode. Honest
  throughout: clearly labelled an estimate, with the variance / unmeasured-per-core
  caveats printed.
- **`--autotune` (E2, the per-host tuner).** Calibrates **only the safe scheduling
  knobs** to the detected host — the local client/thread layout
  (`slaves.nrclients`, e.g. 2 clients × 2 threads on 4 cores) and the work-unit
  *granularity* (`tasks.sieve.qrange`, `tasks.polyselect.adrange`, scaled by a
  bounded √(threads/20) factor clamped to [0.5, 4×]). It **never touches the
  number-theoretic bounds** (`lim*`/`lpb*`/`mfb*`/`I`), which determine relation
  yield and matrix structure — so only the *chunking* of identical work changes and
  `product == N` is preserved by construction. Verified end-to-end: the c59 smoke
  with `--autotune -t 4` set nrclients=2, qrange 2000→1000, adrange 5000→2500,
  logged "bounds unchanged", and returned the correct four prime factors in 15.2 s.
- **New module `scripts/cadofactor/planner.py`** (no third-party deps,
  side-effect-free): the estimator, the duration/feasibility formatting, host
  detection (threads + GPU-present + GPU-build-present), and the autotune override
  computation — all pure and **doctested** (registered as `test_python_planner`).
  Wired into `toplevel.py` via the same print-and-exit pattern as `--suggest-params`
  (plan handled before the parameter file is even resolved, since it needs only N);
  `--autotune` applies after the parameter file is read.

Post-`3.1.0-modern` housekeeping carried in this cycle (no code/behaviour change):

- **Project renamed to `cado-nfs-modern`.** Both the local checkout and the
  GitHub repository were renamed `cado-nfs-3.0.0-modern` → `cado-nfs-modern`
  (GitHub auto-redirects the old URL); the repo's About blurb was reworded.
  `main` was fast-forwarded to the `3.1.0-modern` release tip and is the default
  branch; the interim `v3.1.0-dev` / `v3-modern` branches were removed (all
  contained in `main`; release tags retained).
- **README** rebannered to 3.1.0-modern: badges/links point at `cado-nfs-modern`
  (+ an AVX-512-validation CI badge and a release badge), a "New in 3.1.0-modern"
  section (GPU linalg, GPU pre-factoring, AVX-512 VPCLMULQDQ/IFMA,
  orchestration/UX), a GPU performance note, and the new docs in the index.
- **`.gitignore`** hardened: standalone bench binaries built into the repo root
  (`gpu-prefactor`, `ifma-modmul`, `gpu-spmv-bench`, …), PGO/profiling artifacts
  (`*.gcda`/`*.gcno`/`*.profraw`/`perf.data`), `--json-status` snapshots,
  `autom4te.cache/`, and editor/OS cruft.
- **`BENCHMARKS.md` re-run and reorganized for 3.1.0-modern** (all numbers
  re-measured 2026-06-06 on the i9-10850K + RTX 3090). Restructured into six
  consistent sections — CPU factorization (seeded c60-c90 sweep + per-phase + the
  2.3.x comparison + projections, all `product == N`), the deterministic siever
  microbench (11.67 s, confirming no 3.1.0 CPU-path change), GPU pre-factoring ECM
  (48.7×/25.4×/10.5×), GPU linear algebra (SpMV scaling sweep 30.6→8.1 Gnz/s
  c100→c120 vs CPU 2.25→0.23, + the end-to-end c90 residency anchor, bwc 8.18 s),
  AVX-512 kernels (VPCLMUL `mul1` + IFMA modmul bit-exact under SDE), and a unified
  Reproducing section. README Performance table + GPU note synced to the same
  figures. `CLAUDE.md` updated for the rename + current 3.1.0 state.

## [3.1.0-modern] — 2026-06-06

From 3.1.0-modern the fork carries its own minor line (still upstream 3.0.0's NFS
algorithms; the bump reflects substantial original work beyond a pure mirror).
This release adds GPU linear algebra (SpMV + full vector residency), a GPU
pre-NFS ECM front-end, AVX-512 VPCLMULQDQ/IFMA kernels (SDE-validated), and a
batch of orchestration/UX features. Every change is gated by a verified
`product == N` factorization or a bit-exact validation; hardware-blocked items
(multi-GPU/multi-node, DLP/product-tree) are documented as designs rather than
shipped as unvalidated code.

### GPU (Track 2.2) — linear-algebra SpMV (foundation)

- **Bit-exact GF(2) SpMV on the GPU** (`bench/gpu-spmv-bench.cu`), the kernel
  Block Wiedemann (`linalg/bwc`) runs thousands of times and the
  fastest-growing NFS phase (~110× c60→c90). Mirrors `matmul-basic` exactly
  (`dst[i] = XOR_{j in row i} src[j]`, bitsliced K-limb blocks b64/b128/b256);
  validated bit-exact vs the CPU loop (0 wrong words). With the matrix resident
  on the device (as BWC reuses it), on an RTX 3090 vs a 20-thread i9-10850K it
  reaches 6–15× the *naive* CPU SpMV (7.9 Gnz/s b64, 5.1 b128).
- **Honest comparison vs the real `bucket` backend** (measured with
  `bench_matcache` on real `random_matrix` matrices). Single-thread on a 1M×1M
  30M-nnz matrix: `basic` ~0.35 Gnz/s, `bucket`/`sliced` ~0.63–0.67 (~1.8× the
  naive loop). A **full-CPU threaded scan** (one ~6M-nnz submatrix per thread)
  shows `bucket` is **memory-bandwidth-bound — it saturates at ~1.8 Gnz/s** (only
  ~2.1× the single thread across all 20 threads, flat by ~N=4). So vs the *full
  production CPU*, the GPU b64 kernel (7.9 Gnz/s) is a **measured ~4.4×** — well
  below the inflated "6–15× vs naive" but a real single-machine win, and a floor
  (the kernel realizes only ~10% of GPU bandwidth). The GPU's largest advantage
  remains at *scale* (aggregate multi-GPU/multi-node bandwidth, out-of-core
  matrices). Full design + measured numbers: `docs/gpu-linalg.md`.
- **A real `matmul_bNN_gpu` BWC backend** (`linalg/bwc/matmul-gpu.cu`) plugged
  into CADO's matmul dispatch — `mm_impl=gpu`, registered through the same
  `CONFIGURE_MATMUL_LIB`/`COOKED_BWC_BACKENDS` machinery as `basic`/`bucket`,
  built (b64+b128) only with `-DENABLE_GPU=ON` (nvcc compiles it with all of
  CADO's C++20 arith headers). Mirrors `matmul-basic`'s cache format and keeps
  **both M and Mᵀ resident on-device as CSR** so both BWC directions are fast
  gathers. **Passes `bench_matcache`'s `(M·v₁)·v₂ == (Mᵀ·v₂)·v₁` check — all 4,
  both directions — on a real matrix — and **end-to-end in a real factorization**:
  `cado-nfs.py … tasks.linalg.bwc.mm_impl=gpu` (59-digit, thr=2x2) drives the whole
  BWC pipeline (krylov/lingen/mksol/gather, balanced matrix, multi-thread comm)
  through the GPU backend and returns the correct factors (product == N). The
  backend **pins each reused BWC host
  vector once** (page-locked memory), so all H2D/D2H transfers run at full PCIe
  speed: **6.76 Gnz/s** (up from 4.95 pageable) — **~11× a single `bucket`
  thread, ~3.75× the full-CPU `bucket`** (1.8 Gnz/s). The residual ~1 ms/iter is
  `src`+`dst` still crossing PCIe.
- **Coalesced warp-per-row kernel** (`bench/gpu-spmv-bench.cu` + the backend): lanes
  stride the row's nonzeros (coalesced `col[]`), `src` gathered via `__ldg`,
  K-limb accumulator warp-reduced. Bit-exact (warp PASS / `bench_matcache` 4/4)
  and **1.8–3.1× faster** standalone; in the backend it cut the kernel
  2.63→0.97 ms, lifting end-to-end SpMV to **8.96 Gnz/s — ~5× the full-CPU
  `bucket`**. This flips the bottleneck to **72% transfers / 28% kernel**, so full
  vector residency (the scoped multi-step vector-layer port in
  `docs/gpu-linalg.md`) is now the dominant remaining single-machine win.
- **Comm-on-device foundation** (toward full vector residency — the 72% transfer
  share). Three validated pieces, each gated by a verified factorization
  (`product == N`): (1) a **process-global device-vector registry** keyed by host
  pointer (so the BWC comm can reach *sibling threads'* device buffers — all
  threads share the CUDA context); (2) a **`bwc_base`↔GPU hook ABI**
  (`matmul-gpu-hooks.h`, function pointers the GPU backend installs at init, so
  `bwc_base` keeps no hard CUDA dependency); (3) a **bit-exact device GF(2)
  reduce/broadcast** wired into `mmt_vec_allreduce` behind `CADO_GPU_DEVCOMM`.
  `product == N` on the c60 across thread grids `-t 2/4/6/8` and on a c70, in
  default, `DEVCOMM`, and `VECRESIDENT+DEVCOMM` modes; regression-guarded by a new
  `test_gpu_vecreduce` ctest (GPU builds only).
- **The per-iteration hot comm on device — the 2D "shuffled-product" transpose.**
  A 1-matrix factorization's hot comm is `matmul_top_mul_comm` =
  `mmt_vec_reduce`+`mmt_vec_broadcast`, which reduce-scatters along one grid axis
  and all-gathers along the perpendicular one (coupling all threads' data) — much
  harder than the 1D `allreduce` above. `matmul_top_mul_comm_gpu`
  (`matmul_top_comm.cpp`) runs it on the device-resident buffers by **mirroring
  the host algorithm op-for-op at identical byte offsets** (so it is bit-for-bit
  the host comm by construction): five barriered phases per thread over new
  low-level device-op hooks (`xor_block`/`copy_block`/`upload`/`download`/`ensure`
  in `matmul-gpu-hooks.h`), with the broadcast collapsing to a no-op for the
  common `THREAD_SHARED` source vector. `product == N` on the c60 across `-t 4`
  (2×2 square) and `-t 8` (2×4 rectangular), 10/10 each, in default, `DEVCOMM`,
  and `VECRESIDENT+DEVCOMM` modes; `compute-sanitizer` memcheck on `prep` reports
  0 errors. A flaky data-dependent fault found en route (compute-sanitizer):
  `mul()`'s host-buffer pinning (`cudaHostRegister`) is smaller than the comm's
  full-vector copies and CUDA enforces the registered region — `g_pin` now skips
  under `DEVCOMM` (copies go pageable; the default path keeps pinning).
- **Full vector residency — the steady krylov loop runs entirely on device
  buffers (H2D/D2H eliminated).** With `CADO_GPU_VECRESIDENT` + `CADO_GPU_DEVCOMM`
  the BWC vectors stay device-resident across `mul → comm → mul`: `mul()` skips its
  H2D (device src current) and D2H (dst left on device, host stale); the 2D comm
  skips its host upload of `w` and marks its output `v` device-resident instead of
  writing it back; `matmul_top_mul` no longer invalidates the comm's device result
  in residency mode. Scoped to the krylov inner loop (`cado_gpu_residency_active`,
  set/cleared in `krylov.cpp`) so prep/secure/twist stay host-authoritative; the
  one per-iteration host read (`x_dotprod`) and the loop boundary materialise the
  vector via `cado_gpu_sync_to_host`, and twist/untwist already invalidate the
  device copy so each block re-seeds. **Validated:** `product == N` 45/45 across
  default, `DEVCOMM`, and `VECRESIDENT+DEVCOMM` × `-t 2/4/8`; `compute-sanitizer`
  memcheck on krylov in residency mode reports 0 errors; transfer counters
  (`CADO_GPU_STATS`) confirm the steady loop skips **D2H 100% / H2D ~99%**. This
  eliminates the per-iteration PCIe transfers (the measured ~60% of SpMV time at
  c70/c80, growing with N), realising the ~2.6× SpMV-hot-loop win where linalg
  dominates (large N / DLP). Default and DEVCOMM-only paths are unchanged and
  bit-exact.
- **GPU `x_dotprod` — krylov's last per-iteration D2H removed.** The BW-sequence
  gather (`xdotprod.cpp`) now runs on the device-resident vector
  (`xdot_kernel`, GF(2), x-indices uploaded once and cached) instead of pulling
  the whole vector back to host; `x_dotprod` is residency-aware (device gather, or
  sync + host path if the device copy isn't current). `cado_gpu_residency_available`
  (set by the backend iff both flags are on) gates the residency code paths so they
  engage only in genuine residency runs. `product == N` 18/18 across modes × grids;
  compute-sanitizer clean. With this the steady loop has **zero** per-iteration
  host transfers.
- **Multi-node MPI + per-rank multi-GPU.** The GPU backend builds and runs under
  MPI (build fix: `--mpi` compile marker applied only to non-CUDA languages so
  `matmul-gpu.cu` compiles under nvcc). `gpu_select_device()` binds each process to
  a GPU by its node-local MPI rank (the standard one-rank-per-GPU model;
  `CADO_GPU_DEVICE` overrides). Validated `product == N` with GPU SpMV under 2 MPI
  ranks (`mpi=1x2`/`2x1`) in default, `DEVCOMM`, and `VECRESIDENT+DEVCOMM` modes —
  the device comm safely falls back to the host comm for `njobs>1` (residency is
  single-rank), so multi-rank runs stay correct. On a single GPU the device
  selection is a no-op; it round-robins across GPUs on multi-GPU hardware.
- **mksol full vector residency — transfer-free accumulator.** Extends residency
  from krylov to mksol, whose inner loop does a per-iteration host `addmul_tiny`
  (`ymy[0].own += Σ vi[i].own × ff`, GF(2)) that otherwise forces the accumulator
  back to the CPU each iteration. A bit-exact GPU `addmul_tiny`
  (`bench/gpu-addmul-bench.cu`, validated standalone) runs it on the device, so
  the accumulator stays device-resident across the whole block: mksol seeds the
  constant-per-block `vi[i]` + zeroed accumulator on the device, runs the addmul
  on the GPU (the matmul reuses the krylov residency path), and materialises
  `ymy[0]` at block end for untwist/save. Works because mksol's `ymy[0]` is a
  shared vector, so the standalone `mmt_vec_broadcast` is a no-op. `product == N`
  18/18 across default, `DEVCOMM`, `VECRESIDENT+DEVCOMM` × `-t 4/8`;
  compute-sanitizer clean; mksol's matmul runs fully transfer-free (H2D 100% +
  D2H 100% skipped — even cleaner than krylov, the accumulator is never
  invalidated mid-block). GF(2) only; falls back to the host addmul otherwise.
- **secure full vector residency + single-node residency gate.** `secure`'s
  check-vector accumulator (the same GF(2) `addmul_tiny` as mksol, on the shared
  `dvec`) now uses the device path too, so the last BWC stage that touched the
  accumulator host-side each iteration stays device-resident. With this, residency
  is **gated to the single-node case** in all three drivers (krylov/mksol/secure):
  `pi->wr[0]->njobs == 1 && pi->wr[1]->njobs == 1`. The device comm only handles
  `njobs==1`, and the sync-based MPI fallback yields no transfer win, so under MPI
  residency now cleanly disables and the run takes the validated GPU-SpMV +
  host-comm path (multi-node residency with a real transfer win needs a
  local-device/MPI-data comm split — future work, needs multi-GPU HW to validate).
  Also hardened `g_invalidate`: a host-buffer write (twist, or the MPI host comm)
  now clears `host_dirty` as well as `current`, making the host fully authoritative
  so a later `sync_to_host` cannot D2H stale device data over it. `product == N`:
  single-rank resident `-t 4/8` PASS, `mpi=1x2`/`2x1` resident (disabled) PASS,
  default/`DEVCOMM`/resident 12/12 PASS; compute-sanitizer clean.
- **Build fix — GPU backend links into standalone matmul tools.** The
  `cado_gpu_*` comm-on-device hook pointers were *defined* in `bwc_base`
  (`matmul_top_comm.cpp`), which the GPU matmul backend references but
  `bench_matcache` does not fully pull in — a circular static-link dependency left
  the symbols unresolved (`bench_matcache --impl gpu` failed to link). The
  definitions moved to a new dependency-free leaf TU `matmul-gpu-hooks.cpp`
  compiled into `matmul_common` (the leaf every backend already links), so both
  `bwc_base` (which calls the hooks) and the GPU backend (which installs them)
  resolve them with no cycle and no CUDA dependency in CPU-only builds. Behaviour
  is byte-identical (null pointers ⇒ host comm). Re-validated end-to-end after a
  full relink: c59 GPU `product == N`.
- **Intra-node multi-GPU matrix partition (`CADO_GPU_NPART`).** The GPU SpMV
  backend can split each direction's CSR into `nparts` contiguous output-row
  chunks placed round-robin across the visible GPUs; `mul()` runs one partial
  SpMV per chunk (src replicated to each device) and gathers the dst chunks.
  Default `nparts=1` is exactly the prior single-device path (zero overhead). On
  a single GPU every chunk maps to device 0, which **exercises the
  split/multi-launch/gather logic bit-exactly** — `product == N` validated on the
  c59 at `CADO_GPU_NPART=1/2/3` (identical factors). Genuine cross-physical-device
  execution (2+ GPUs, and the per-device-stream overlap that would make it a
  throughput win) is **unverified here — this box has one RTX 3090** — and is the
  documented next step (`docs/gpu-linalg.md`). The path is independent of vector
  residency (alternative strategies); `nparts>1` takes the plain
  upload/compute/writeback path.
- **Multi-node residency — design documented (not code).** The transfer-win
  version of residency-under-MPI is specified in `docs/gpu-linalg.md` (the
  local-device-reduce / MPI-boundary-only-exchange split) rather than implemented,
  for a concrete reason: transfer accounting shows any version that routes the
  comm through host MPI just moves the two per-iteration transfers from the mul to
  the comm (**no net win** — confirming why residency is single-node-gated), and
  the only winning version needs ≥2 GPUs (ideally CUDA-aware MPI) to realise *and*
  to validate for correctness (an earlier attempt hit a reduce-scatter
  direction/offset bug and was reverted rather than ship a comm returning wrong
  results). The doc gives the full algorithm + buffer choreography so it drops
  into `matmul_top_mul_comm_gpu`'s `njobs>1` branch when multi-GPU HW is available.
- **GPU linalg at scale — measured (Track 2.2 headline).** A scaling sweep
  (`bench/gpu-spmv-bench.cu`, b64, bit-exact at every size) shows the GPU SpMV
  win **grows with N**: GPU warp kernel 28.9→7.9 Gnz/s as the matrix grows
  1M→8M rows (240M nnz, c100→c120 scale), while the CPU reference loop collapses
  1.58→0.19 Gnz/s (random-CSR cache thrash) — 18×→41× over the reference loop, a
  steadier ~4.4× over the tuned `bucket`'s saturated ~1.8 Gnz/s. End-to-end anchor:
  a 90-digit GNFS with `mm_impl=gpu` + residency returns `product == N` (bwc 8.18s
  real — small at c90, sieving-dominated). Recorded in `BENCHMARKS.md`.

### CPU/SIMD (Track 1.1) — AVX-512 VPCLMULQDQ gf2x auto-detection

- **gf2x VPCLMULQDQ backend auto-detection.** `gf2x/config/features.m4` adds
  `CHECK_VPCLMUL_SUPPORT` (+ a `VPCLMUL_EXAMPLE` using `_mm512_clmulepi64_epi128`)
  and `configure.ac` prefers the `x86_64_vpclmul` backend over `x86_64_pclmul`
  when supported. Because the probe uses `AC_RUN_IFELSE`, it only says "yes" when
  the test program actually runs — so a non-AVX-512 host (the Comet Lake reference
  box) reports "no" and keeps the pclmul backend: **no mis-selection, no
  regression** (verified: regenerated `configure` selects `x86_64_pclmul` here and
  gf2x's own `make check` passes). On real AVX-512 silicon the VPCLMULQDQ backend
  (hot `mul1` accelerated; `mul2`–`mul9` are the proven PCLMUL code, valid there)
  is selected automatically.
- **`mul1` bit-exact under Intel SDE** (`bench/vpclmul-validate.sh`, now
  auto-finding `/opt/intel-sde/sde64`): PASS, 200 000 trials vs the scalar
  reference — the primary Drucker–Gueron base-case win.
- **CI validation** (`.github/workflows/avx512-validate.yml`): regenerates
  `configure` (autoreconf, in CI's clean autotools env — so the source commit
  doesn't churn this box's vendored libtool/automake), checks the auto-detection,
  validates `mul1` under SDE (objdump fallback if SDE is unavailable), and — when
  SDE is present — force-builds the `x86_64_vpclmul` backend and runs gf2x's tests
  under `sde64 -future`. Correctness-only; the ~39% perf gain is measurable only on
  AVX-512 hardware. Remaining (perf-gated): port `mul2`–`mul9` to VPCLMULQDQ +
  threshold retune (see `gf2x/already_tuned/x86_64_vpclmul/INTEGRATION.md`).

### CPU/SIMD (Track 1.4) — AVX-512 IFMA GF(p) modmul kernel (foundation)

- **Bit-exact AVX-512-IFMA batched Montgomery modular multiplication**
  (`bench/ifma-modmul.c`): the foundation kernel for an mpfq GF(p) IFMA backend
  (DLP linear algebra). It does **8 independent modmuls per instruction stream**
  (one per 512-bit lane) in radix 2^52 — the natural IFMA radix, so partial
  products land exactly in the lo/hi halves `_mm512_madd52lo/hi_epu64` produce —
  via a lane-parallel CIOS Montgomery. Validated **bit-exact vs GMP under Intel
  SDE** (`bench/ifma-validate.sh`, `-future`): **0/32000 wrong, 260-bit, 8-way.**
  Same method as the gf2x VPCLMULQDQ work (Comet Lake has no IFMA; SDE emulates
  it). CI-gated in `.github/workflows/avx512-validate.yml` (objdump `vpmadd52`
  fallback if SDE is unavailable). Full mpfq integration (wiring it into the
  generated GF(p) arithmetic + the BWC GF(p) SpMV, and a perf number on real
  IFMA silicon) is follow-up; this proves the arithmetic primitive.
- **Cofactor scale-out + GPU product-tree — design documented** (Tracks 2.3/2.4,
  `docs/gpu-cofactorization.md`). The multi-GPU curve-batching *mechanism* already
  exists and is validated at N=1 (`misc/gpu_prefactor` splits across
  `cudaGetDeviceCount()` devices); what remains — distributing across ≥2 GPUs,
  MPI-awareness, and DLP tuning — is HW/regime-gated, not algorithmic, so it is
  specified rather than shipped. GPU batch product-tree smoothness (Bernstein
  remainder tree, flag-gated) is a new algorithm requiring a bit-exact
  relation-set harness; designed to reuse the validated multi-precision device
  arithmetic (`bench/gpu-ecm-mp.cu`, `bench/ifma-modmul.c`).

### CPU (Track 1.2) — PGO retry (honest negative)

- **Siever-trained PGO retry — rejected again.** v3.0.0 rejected whole-program PGO
  (+2.8% slower). This retry instrumented only the `las` objects
  (`-fprofile-generate`), trained on a multi-seed c120 sampled-special-q corpus,
  then rebuilt with `-fprofile-use` (gcc; `-fprofile-partial-training` so the rest
  stays `-O3`). Measured on `bench/las-microbench.sh` (deterministic, <1%
  variance): **12.04s vs 11.69s baseline = +3.0% slower** — no win, consistent
  with v3.0.0. The `-O3 -march=native` host-ISA codegen already captures the gain;
  PGO's layout/inlining choices do not help this siever. Recorded, not adopted.

### CPU (Track 1.3) — hot-scalar micro-opt (profiled; no safe win)

- **Profiled the siever; the hot loops are already optimally tuned.** A `perf`
  profile of the c120 microbench workload puts the self-time in
  `fill_in_buckets` (~12%), `plattice_info` ctor (~11%), `sieve_small_bucket_region`
  (~10%), ECM `stage2_one_w` (~10%), `invmod_redc_32` (~9.5%), and
  `apply_buckets_inner` (~7%). The bucket-apply scatter — the obvious software-
  prefetch candidate — is already 16×-unrolled with batched 64-bit reads, SIMD,
  and an update-stream prefetch (`las-apply-buckets.hpp`), and its scatter target
  `S[x]` is cache-resident *by design* (bucket regions are sized to fit cache).
  The remaining candidate, batched modular inversion (Montgomery's trick) in
  `invmod_redc_32`/`plattice_info`, needs an invasive restructuring of per-prime
  lattice setup — high correctness risk on a tight 9.5% routine, with expected
  nil-to-negative payoff given the two PGO negatives and how hand-tuned the code
  already is. **No micro-opt adopted**; the `-O3 -march=native` codegen win
  already captures what is safely available. Recorded per the measure-and-record
  ethos.

### UI/UX (Track 3.1) — run-status reporting

- **`--json-status FILE`** writes a machine-readable status snapshot (schema
  `cado-nfs-status/1`: state, phase + index/total, percent, ETA, work-unit
  counts, factors, timestamps), rewritten atomically on every update — for
  dashboards/tooling and the forthcoming `/status` endpoint.
- **`--progress`** shows a compact single-line progress indicator (phase ·
  percent · work-units · ETA) on stderr (pair with `--screenlog WARNING` for a
  clean line).
- New dependency-free `scripts/cadofactor/status.py` singleton, fed by the
  existing phase loop (`CompleteFactorization.run`) and per-work-unit
  `verification()` (which already computed achievement + ETA). Off by default; no
  behaviour change unless a flag is given. Validated on a 59-digit factorization.

### UI/UX (Track 3.2) — /status endpoint + dashboard

- **`GET /status` on both servers.** The Flask work-unit server
  (`api_server.py`) serves the live `cado-nfs-status/1` snapshot (state, phase +
  index/total, percent, ETA, work-unit counts, factors) straight from the
  in-process status singleton, and the Rust `cado-wu-server` serves a
  `cado-nfs-wu-status/1` snapshot (work-units total/available/assigned/ok/error/
  done + percent + serving flag) computed from the wudb it already owns. Both
  reuse data the servers already hold — no new bookkeeping.
- **`GET /dashboard`** (Flask) is a dependency-free single-page view that polls
  `/status` every 2 s and renders phase / progress bar / ETA / work-units /
  factors. Inline HTML, no static-asset plumbing.
- The Track 3.1 status reporter (`status.py`) now **tracks state in memory
  unconditionally** (the file/stderr *output* stays gated on
  `--json-status`/`--progress`), so `/status` is live even when no status flag was
  passed. Validated live: a running c90 factorization reported phase "Polynomial
  Selection (root optimized)" [2/12] via `GET /status`; the Rust endpoint reported
  correct per-status work-unit counts against a seeded wudb.

### UI/UX (Track 3.3) — parameter interpolation

- **Parameter interpolation instead of a hard error.** When no preset parameter
  file matches the input size (after the existing ±3/±5-digit search window),
  `find_default_parameter_file` (`toplevel.py`) now **interpolates** a file from
  the two nearest presets that bracket the size — linearly scaling every numeric
  key present in both (`lim*`, `lpb*`, `mfb*`, `I`, `qmin`, `ncurves*`,
  `target_density`, …) by the fractional digit position, rounding integer keys,
  and preserving the nearer preset's structure/comments. If the size is outside
  the available preset range it clamps to the nearest single preset. Either way it
  emits a clear "heuristic; override with `-p`" warning, so off-preset sizes
  (e.g. a cofactor returned by `--gpu-prefactor`, or any gap such as c45 between
  the c30 and c60 presets) get usable parameters instead of aborting the run.
- **`--suggest-params`** resolves the parameter file for `N` (interpolating if
  needed), prints its path and contents, and exits without factoring — a quick way
  to inspect or capture a starting point to hand-tune.
- Validated: `product == N` on a real 45-digit factorization driven entirely by
  auto-interpolated c30↔c60 parameters; all 299 `toplevel.py` doctests pass
  (the three that asserted the old "no parameter file found" error now assert the
  interpolated-file behaviour). No change when an exact/near preset exists.

### UI/UX (Track 3.4) — clap CLIs + cluster launcher

- **clap argument parsing for both Rust binaries.** `cado-wu-server-rs` and
  `cado-nfs-client-rs` replace their hand-rolled `parse_args` loops with `clap`
  derive parsers, gaining real `--help`/`--version`, value validation, and clear
  errors. Every flag name and semantic is preserved (server `--db` still required,
  `--whitelist` still comma-separated/repeatable; client `--server` still
  repeatable for failover, the TLS flags `--insecure`/`--cafile`/`--certsha1`
  still set the `CADO_NFS_*` env vars the client reads). Validated end-to-end:
  `rust/server-interop-test.sh` and `rust/server-swap-test.sh` PASS — the latter
  drives a full c59 `product == N` with the Rust server swapped in via the Python
  shim, launched with the exact `--db/--addr/--port/--uploaddir/--whitelist`
  arguments the new parser handles.
- **`scripts/cluster-launch.sh`** fans the static Rust client across a cluster:
  SSH host list (`--hosts`/`--hostfile`, `--clients-per-host`) or Slurm
  (`--slurm --ntasks`), all pointed at one `--server` with the same `--certsha1`
  pinning; `--stop` kills the clients, `--dry-run` previews. Auto-finds the client
  binary in the build/Rust target dirs.
- **`cado-nfs-monitor-rs`** — a ratatui terminal dashboard that polls a server's
  `/status` and renders a live progress gauge, phase/state, work-unit counts, ETA,
  and discovered factors. Understands both schemas (`cado-nfs-status/1` from the
  Flask driver and `cado-nfs-wu-status/1` from the Rust server). `--once` prints a
  plain-text summary and exits (scriptable / no-TTY). Validated `--once` against
  both a live Rust work-unit server and a `cado-nfs-status/1` document
  (c120 `[5/12] Lattice Sieving` 63.4%, wu 820/1300, ETA rendered).

### GPU (Track 2.1) — pre-NFS factoring front-end (validated)

- **Multi-precision (K-limb) GPU ECM.** The existing GPU ECM
  (`sieve/ecm/gpu_ecm.cu`) only handles moduli < 2^126 — useless for stripping a
  factor from a real NFS-sized N, since ECM runs *modulo N*. `bench/gpu-ecm-mp.cu`
  generalizes the validated 2-limb CIOS Montgomery and the Montgomery-curve XZ
  ladder to K 64-bit limbs, so ECM stage-1 runs modulo a multi-hundred-bit N. The
  same `__host__ __device__` code runs on CPU and GPU; **validated bit-exact**:
  `montmul` 0/20000 wrong vs an independent binary-mulmod reference and ECM
  0/512 GPU lanes differing from CPU, for 128/256/512-bit widths. Functionally it
  **strips a planted ~20-bit factor from near-full-width composites** (~520k /
  135k / 30k curves/s for 128/256/512-bit on an RTX 3090). This is the math
  foundation for the standalone `--gpu-prefactor` stage.
- **Standalone `gpu-prefactor` tool** (`misc/gpu_prefactor/`): a working CLI that
  strips factors from a decimal `N` on the GPU before NFS (which CADO already
  tells users to do by hand). Width `K ∈ {2,4,8,16}` (up to ~307-digit `N`) is
  chosen automatically; GMP handles parsing, the Montgomery setup, and `gcd`.
  Demonstrated stripping a 12-digit factor from a 103-digit `N` (cofactor
  correctly identified prime). Unlike in-sieve GPU cofactorization (a documented
  Amdahl no-win), pre-factoring is a *separate* stage, so the GPU throughput is
  pure upside.
- **Stage-2 BSGS + Suyama-σ curves** (generalizing `bench/gpu-ecm-stage2.cu` to
  K limbs). The Suyama setup's one modular inverse per curve is done on the host
  with GMP (non-invertible denominators are themselves free factors); the device
  runs stage-1 + a baby-step/giant-step stage-2 over the primes in (B1,B2]. Each
  run does a bit-exact GPU-vs-CPU self-check of the new BSGS composition
  (`# selfcheck: PASS`). This lifts the reach from ~12-digit to **15-digit
  factors** (e.g. stripped a 15-digit factor from a 102-digit N; a 14-digit from
  a 95-digit N) at the same `B1`. CLI: `gpu-prefactor <N> [B1] [curves] [B2]`.
- **Multi-GPU** batching: the curve batch is split across all visible devices and
  launched asynchronously (concurrent), degenerating to a single launch on a
  one-GPU box. Plus a **CMake target** (`misc/CMakeLists.txt`, built when
  `-DENABLE_GPU=ON`): `make gpu-prefactor`, installed to `<libdir>/misc`. The
  target forces device `-O3` (CADO sets no `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, so default CUDA
  flags are unoptimized — a ~30× trap) and defaults to `sm_86`
  (`-DCADO_GPU_ARCH=` to override). The CMake build matches the standalone nvcc
  throughput (~550 curves/s, stage1+2, 512-bit on an RTX 3090).
- **`cado-nfs.py --gpu-prefactor`** integration (`scripts/cadofactor/gpu_prefactor.py`):
  runs the GPU stage before NFS, with `--gpu-b1/--gpu-b2/--gpu-curves`. If it
  fully factors N (cofactor 1 or prime), it prints the factorization and **skips
  NFS entirely**; if a composite cofactor remains, it finishes with a fresh
  `cado-nfs.py` on the cofactor (which selects parameters for the cofactor's
  size); if nothing is stripped or the GPU binary is absent, it falls through to
  a normal run. Only prime gcd-divisors are trusted (verified by Miller–Rabin).
  Validated: a 90-digit N (14-digit × 76-digit prime) was factored entirely by
  the GPU pre-stage in seconds, **product == N**, NFS skipped; normal runs
  without the flag are unaffected.
- **Staged-`B1` schedule** (`gpu-prefactor <N> staged [maxdigits] [scale]`):
  escalating `B1` (2000 → 11000 → 50000 → 250000 → 1e6 → 3e6) so small factors
  are found cheaply before spending curves at high `B1`; stops as soon as the
  cofactor is 1/prime. Reaches ~20–30-digit factors.
- **CPU-vs-GPU benchmark** (`bench/gpu-prefactor-bench.cu`): the *same* `ecm_run2`
  on the GPU vs the full 20-thread CPU (`std::thread`) — **49× / 25× / 11×** at
  128/256/512-bit on an RTX 3090 vs i9-10850K (the advantage shrinks at wider
  moduli as register/local-memory pressure lowers GPU occupancy — honest caveat).
  Recorded in `BENCHMARKS.md`. (Caught and fixed a dead-code-elimination trap: the
  CPU side needs an observable sink or the optimizer removes the whole ECM.)
- **Canonical deep-dive doc** (`docs/gpu-prefactor.md`): the why (separate stage,
  no Amdahl ceiling — contrast with `docs/gpu-cofactorization.md`), the
  multi-precision Montgomery ECM, the correctness gates, build/run, the integrated
  `--gpu-prefactor` path, and the measured throughput table. Benchmark re-confirmed
  on the RTX 3090 (48.6× / 25.9× / 12.2× at 128/256/512-bit, within noise of the
  recorded figures) and an end-to-end `staged` run on a 90-digit N verified
  `product == N` (every stripped factor divides N; cofactor × stripped-product == N;
  self-check PASS throughout).

## [3.0.0-modern] — 2026-06-05

Rebases the modernization effort onto upstream CADO-NFS **3.0.0** and adds four
tracks of rigorously-measured performance / robustness work. **No NFS
mathematics is changed** — every track is an implementation, build, or
orchestration optimization, and correctness (verified `product == N`
factorizations + `make check`) is the gate after each phase. Results are
reported honestly, including the parts that did *not* pay off.

Reference box for all measurements: **i9-10850K (10C/20T, Comet Lake → no
AVX-512) + RTX 3090 (Ampere, `sm_86`), 64 GiB, CachyOS.**

### Phase 0 — rebase onto upstream 3.0.0

- Builds cleanly on a current box (**CMake 4.x, GCC 16, C++20, Python 3.14**).
  3.0.0 already subsumes the 2.3.x portability fixes and brings, for free, the
  Bouvier–Imbert batch cofactorization (eprint 2018/669) and `I>16` sieving.
- The Flask/`requests` orchestration deps live in a venv
  (`scripts/setup-venv.sh`, pointed at by `local.sh`) rather than the system.
- Baseline established with a verified smoke factorization.

### Phase 1 — build & compiler (measured, not guessed)

- `bench/las-microbench.sh`: a deterministic siever microbenchmark (pinned c120
  polynomial + `las --random-sample N --seed S`, <1% CPU variance) that makes
  few-percent changes measurable despite the ~15–20% end-to-end polyselect noise.
- Result on the c120 siever workload (mean of 3, <1% variance):

  | flags | time | vs stock |
  |---|---|---|
  | stock `-O2` | 12.57 s | — |
  | `-O2 -march=native` | 11.79 s | −6.2% |
  | **`-O3 -march=native`** | **11.66 s** | **−7.2% (adopted)** |
  | `+LTO` | — | 0% (and breaks `-Werror`) → rejected |
  | `+PGO` | — | +2.8% (regresses) → rejected |

  `-march=native` (AVX2/BMI2/FMA host codegen) is the only real win; LTO and PGO
  are rejected on evidence. Final flags adopted in `local.sh`.

### Phase 2 — SIMD modernization

- **AVX2 on the siever: ruled out by profiling.** The hot path is scatter
  (`fill_in_buckets`, small-sieve) plus scalar modular arithmetic
  (`invmod_redc_32`, `plattice_info`), not vectorizable loops; the explicitly
  SSE2 survivor code is cold. Widening it would not move the needle.
- **AVX-512 VPCLMULQDQ gf2x base-case multiply** (the GF(2)[x] hot path used by
  `lingen`): `bench/vpclmul-mul1n.c` implements `mul_1_n`/`addmul_1_n` at four
  carryless multiplies per instruction (vs one per 128-bit `pclmul`), validated
  **bit-exact over 200 000 random trials under Intel SDE**
  (`bench/vpclmul-validate.sh`). `gf2x/already_tuned/x86_64_vpclmul/` carries the
  gf2x-integrated backend plus an `INTEGRATION.md` completion guide. Performance
  is gated on real AVX-512 silicon — the reference box is Comet Lake, so this is
  validated correct-only here.

### Phase 3 — GPU ECM cofactorization (RTX 3090) — validated, honest negative

- `bench/gpu-modmul-bench.cu`: batched 64-bit Montgomery modmul (ECM's inner
  primitive) — **~279 G modmul/s on the 3090 vs ~7.2 G across 20 CPU cores
  (~39×)**, correctness-checked.
- `bench/gpu-ecm.cu`: a complete batched ECM stage-1 (Montgomery-curve XZ ladder,
  on-device binary gcd). The same `__host__ __device__` code runs on CPU and GPU,
  so the GPU path is **bit-exact**; it cracks 256/256 test composites at
  ~2.75 M curves/s (B1=2000). Extended with Suyama-σ curves, a 128-bit Montgomery
  modulus (CIOS REDC), and a stage-2 BSGS continuation (+64% yield/curve).
- Integrated into CADO behind `facul`/`las-cofactor` with a CMake CUDA build and
  a live batched-drain hook (relations validated identical to the CPU path).
- **Honest conclusion (`docs/gpu-cofactorization.md`):** cofactorization is only
  ~8% of siever time (Amdahl ceiling), and a mid-effort "throughput win" turned
  out to be a correctness bug (a single-factor batch emitting relations with
  primes > `lpb`; fixed in `c675f82` with a complete-factorization check). With
  correctness enforced there is **no net single-machine speedup** from the GPU at
  these sizes — the value would be a cheaper-cofactorization *parameter-regime
  shift* on much larger inputs. Documented as a measured negative result rather
  than an unsubstantiated win.

### Phase 4 — Rust orchestration (robustness / scalability)

Ports the **network/DB substrate** of the distributed layer to async Rust while
keeping the **exact existing HTTP/JSON work-unit protocol**, so Rust binaries
interoperate with an unmodified `cado-nfs.py` during migration. This buys
robustness (no GIL, connection pooling, a single static client binary), not
single-machine factoring speed. Full details in `docs/rust-orchestration.md`.

- **`cado-nfs-client-rs`** (`rust/cado-nfs-client`, reqwest + rustls, no OpenSSL):
  the complete client loop — fetch work-unit, download + checksum-verify
  (sha1/256/3-256) inputs, run commands (argv split, no shell, exactly as the
  Python client), upload results. Plus failover across multiple `--server` URLs,
  TLS cert-pinning (`--certsha1`), `--niceness`, download `flock`, and `STDIN<n>`
  redirection (which the stock Python client never implemented).
- **`cado-wu-server-rs`** (`rust/cado-wu-server`, axum + tokio + bundled
  rusqlite): the five endpoints over the same `wudb` SQLite schema and status
  codes, replicating the `WuAccess` assign/result lifecycle, with stale-work
  timeout reassignment, `410`-after-finish, an r2d2/WAL connection pool, TLS
  (`--cert/--key`), and IP-whitelist enforcement (`--whitelist`, IPv4/IPv6
  exact + CIDR, matching `api_server.py`'s `api_limit_remote_addr`).
- **In-process swap:** `scripts/cadofactor/external_api_server.py` (`ExternalApiServer`)
  implements the `ApiServer` interface the driver uses by launching the Rust
  server over the same database; `cadotask.py` switches to it when
  `CADO_RUST_WU_SERVER` is set. TLS is wired (the shim regenerates the same
  self-signed cert and reports its SHA1 so clients pin it) and the whitelist is
  passed through.
- **`cadotask.py` is deliberately left in Python.** Phase 4's scope is the
  substrate, not the scheduler DAG; porting ~7.5K LOC of orchestration logic has
  no robustness/throughput payoff and a large correctness surface, so it stays
  behind the stable `ApiServer` seam.
- **Validation:** `rust/interop-test.sh` (Rust client ↔ stock Python server),
  `rust/server-interop-test.sh` (full lifecycle, Rust server + client),
  `rust/robustness-test.sh` (**13/13**), `rust/deploy-test.sh` (a real 59-digit
  factorization run entirely by external Rust clients), `rust/server-swap-test.sh`
  (Rust server swapped into a live `cado-nfs.py` run, plain HTTP) and
  `rust/server-swap-tls-test.sh` (the same over TLS with cert-pinning + whitelist).

### Net finding

CPU-side tuning is nearly tapped out on this hand-optimized codebase (Phase 1
~7%, Phase 2 AVX2 nil). The structural headroom is in *new compute resources* —
the GPU (validated ~39× on the modmul primitive, though Amdahl-bounded at these
sizes) and, where available, AVX-512 VPCLMULQDQ (validated correct) — and in the
Rust orchestration substrate for multi-client robustness.

### Versioning

- `CADO_VERSION_STRING` is `3.0.0-modern` (`CMakeLists.txt`); the numeric
  components stay at upstream 3.0.0, only the display string is suffixed. No test
  depends on the version string.

## [2.3.1-modern] — 2026-06-04

First release of the modernization fork. Upstream CADO-NFS 2.3.0 (2017) does
not build or run unmodified on a current toolchain. This release makes the
2.3.0 codebase build cleanly and factor numbers end-to-end on
**CMake 4.x, GCC 16, hwloc 2.x, OpenSSL 3.x, and Python 3.14**, with no change
to the underlying algorithms.

### Build system

- **CMake 4.x compatibility.** CMake 4 removed compatibility with policies
  below 3.5, but CADO-NFS declares `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.11)`.
  `local.sh` now passes `-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5` via
  `CMAKE_EXTRA_ARGS` so configuration succeeds. (Harmless on older CMake.)
- **GCC 10+ `-fno-common`.** Modern GCC defaults to `-fno-common`, turning the
  project's tentative global definitions (e.g. `bw` in `linalg/bwc`) into
  multiple-definition link errors. `local.sh` now sets `CFLAGS="-O2 -fcommon"`.
- **gf2x ISO C90 generator.** `gf2x/lowlevel/gen_bb_mul_code.c` is compiled by
  gf2x's *build-system* compiler in ISO C90, where `//` comments are illegal.
  One dead-code `//` comment was converted to `/* … */`.
- **Version bumped** `2.3.0` → `2.3.1` (`CMakeLists.txt`).
- `local.sh` is now committed (it carries only portable, machine-independent
  build flags) so the tree builds out-of-the-box.

### C/C++

- **hwloc 1.x → 2.x port** in `linalg/bwc/cpubinding.cpp`. The removed
  `HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IO_DEVICES` / `HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IO_BRIDGES` topology
  flags are replaced by `hwloc_topology_set_io_types_filter(topology,
  HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_NONE)`, version-guarded with
  `#if HWLOC_API_VERSION >= 0x00020000` so hwloc 1.x still compiles. Behaviour
  is preserved: I/O devices are excluded from the topology, which is also the
  hwloc-2.x default.

### Python orchestration (`scripts/cadofactor/`, `cado-nfs-client.py`)

- **`fractions.gcd` → `math.gcd`** (`cadotask.py`); `fractions.gcd` was removed
  in Python 3.9. Guarded with a fallback import for very old Pythons.
- **`collections.*` ABCs → `collections.abc.*`** (`wudb.py`); the
  `collections.MutableMapping` / `Mapping` / `Container` aliases were removed in
  Python 3.10.
- **HTTPS work-unit server** (`wuserver.py`):
  - Server certificate key size raised 1024 → 2048 bits; OpenSSL 3.x rejects
    keys below 2048 (`EE_KEY_TOO_SMALL`).
  - `ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23` → `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER` (the former is deprecated).
  - Added `FixedHTTPServer.handle_error` to swallow the benign
    connection-teardown from the client's certificate-download probe, which
    previously printed an alarming (but harmless) `BrokenPipeError` traceback.
- **HTTPS work-unit client** (`cado-nfs-client.py`):
  - `urllib.request.urlopen(..., cafile=…)` → `urlopen(..., context=
    ssl.create_default_context(cafile=…))`; the `cafile`/`capath`/`cadefault`
    parameters were removed from `urlopen()` in Python 3.12. This was the
    failure that left clients unable to fetch work units and the run hung.
  - The `NO_CN_CHECK` setting (skip hostname verification) is now honoured on
    Python 3 instead of raising "not implemented".

### Verification

- Full build completes (100%, exit 0) on the reference machine
  (CachyOS, GCC 16.1.1, GMP 6.3.0, hwloc 2.13.0, OpenSSL 3.x, Python 3.14.5).
- A 59-digit demo factorization
  (`90377629292003121684002147101760858109247336549001090677693`) completes in
  ~30 s **over HTTPS**, producing four 15-digit primes whose product equals the
  input; the Linear-Algebra (Block-Wiedemann) phase exercises the ported
  `cpubinding.cpp`.
- Targeted unit-test subsets (`test_bitlinalg*`, `sievetest*`) pass.

### Not changed

- No algorithmic, numerical, or parameter changes — this fork is a portability
  layer only.
- Upstream source style is preserved; no bulk reformatting.
- Multi-machine/distributed mode is unchanged in spirit; only the shared SSL
  layer was modernized (now exercised successfully on localhost over HTTPS).
