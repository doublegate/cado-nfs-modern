# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
loosely follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

This is a downstream **modernization + performance fork** of upstream
[CADO-NFS](https://gitlab.inria.fr/cado-nfs/cado-nfs). The `3.0.x-modern` line is
rebased onto upstream **3.0.0**; only the changes introduced by this fork are
listed. For the upstream history see [`NEWS`](NEWS). The earlier `2.3.1-modern`
release (rebased on upstream 2.3.0) lives on the `main` branch.

## [Unreleased] — 3.1.0-modern

From 3.1.0-modern the fork carries its own minor line (still upstream 3.0.0's NFS
algorithms; the bump reflects substantial original work beyond a pure mirror).
Work in progress — see the v3.1.0 roadmap. Landed so far:

### GPU (Track 2.2) — linear-algebra SpMV (foundation)

- **Bit-exact GF(2) SpMV on the GPU** (`bench/gpu-spmv-bench.cu`), the kernel
  Block Wiedemann (`linalg/bwc`) runs thousands of times and the
  fastest-growing NFS phase (~110× c60→c90). Mirrors `matmul-basic` exactly
  (`dst[i] = XOR_{j in row i} src[j]`, bitsliced K-limb blocks b64/b128/b256);
  validated bit-exact vs the CPU loop (0 wrong words). With the matrix resident
  on the device (as BWC reuses it), on an RTX 3090 vs a 20-thread i9-10850K it
  reaches 6–15× the *naive* CPU SpMV (7.9 Gnz/s b64, 5.1 b128).
- **Honest comparison vs the real `bucket` backend** (measured with
  `bench_matcache` on real `random_matrix` matrices). Single-thread on a 1M×1M
  30M-nnz matrix: `basic` ~0.35 Gnz/s, `bucket`/`sliced` ~0.63–0.67 (~1.8× the
  naive loop). A **full-CPU threaded scan** (one ~6M-nnz submatrix per thread)
  shows `bucket` is **memory-bandwidth-bound — it saturates at ~1.8 Gnz/s** (only
  ~2.1× the single thread across all 20 threads, flat by ~N=4). So vs the *full
  production CPU*, the GPU b64 kernel (7.9 Gnz/s) is a **measured ~4.4×** — well
  below the inflated "6–15× vs naive" but a real single-machine win, and a floor
  (the kernel realizes only ~10% of GPU bandwidth). The GPU's largest advantage
  remains at *scale* (aggregate multi-GPU/multi-node bandwidth, out-of-core
  matrices). Next: a `matmul_bNN_gpu` backend + multi-GPU via the existing MPI
  balancing. Full design + measured numbers: `docs/gpu-linalg.md`.

### UI/UX (Track 3.1) — run-status reporting

- **`--json-status FILE`** writes a machine-readable status snapshot (schema
  `cado-nfs-status/1`: state, phase + index/total, percent, ETA, work-unit
  counts, factors, timestamps), rewritten atomically on every update — for
  dashboards/tooling and the forthcoming `/status` endpoint.
- **`--progress`** shows a compact single-line progress indicator (phase ·
  percent · work-units · ETA) on stderr (pair with `--screenlog WARNING` for a
  clean line).
- New dependency-free `scripts/cadofactor/status.py` singleton, fed by the
  existing phase loop (`CompleteFactorization.run`) and per-work-unit
  `verification()` (which already computed achievement + ETA). Off by default; no
  behaviour change unless a flag is given. Validated on a 59-digit factorization.

### GPU (Track 2.1) — pre-NFS factoring front-end (foundation)

- **Multi-precision (K-limb) GPU ECM.** The existing GPU ECM
  (`sieve/ecm/gpu_ecm.cu`) only handles moduli < 2^126 — useless for stripping a
  factor from a real NFS-sized N, since ECM runs *modulo N*. `bench/gpu-ecm-mp.cu`
  generalizes the validated 2-limb CIOS Montgomery and the Montgomery-curve XZ
  ladder to K 64-bit limbs, so ECM stage-1 runs modulo a multi-hundred-bit N. The
  same `__host__ __device__` code runs on CPU and GPU; **validated bit-exact**:
  `montmul` 0/20000 wrong vs an independent binary-mulmod reference and ECM
  0/512 GPU lanes differing from CPU, for 128/256/512-bit widths. Functionally it
  **strips a planted ~20-bit factor from near-full-width composites** (~520k /
  135k / 30k curves/s for 128/256/512-bit on an RTX 3090). This is the math
  foundation for the standalone `--gpu-prefactor` stage.
- **Standalone `gpu-prefactor` tool** (`misc/gpu_prefactor/`): a working CLI that
  strips factors from a decimal `N` on the GPU before NFS (which CADO already
  tells users to do by hand). Width `K ∈ {2,4,8,16}` (up to ~307-digit `N`) is
  chosen automatically; GMP handles parsing, the Montgomery setup, and `gcd`.
  Demonstrated stripping a 12-digit factor from a 103-digit `N` (cofactor
  correctly identified prime). Unlike in-sieve GPU cofactorization (a documented
  Amdahl no-win), pre-factoring is a *separate* stage, so the GPU throughput is
  pure upside.
- **Stage-2 BSGS + Suyama-σ curves** (generalizing `bench/gpu-ecm-stage2.cu` to
  K limbs). The Suyama setup's one modular inverse per curve is done on the host
  with GMP (non-invertible denominators are themselves free factors); the device
  runs stage-1 + a baby-step/giant-step stage-2 over the primes in (B1,B2]. Each
  run does a bit-exact GPU-vs-CPU self-check of the new BSGS composition
  (`# selfcheck: PASS`). This lifts the reach from ~12-digit to **15-digit
  factors** (e.g. stripped a 15-digit factor from a 102-digit N; a 14-digit from
  a 95-digit N) at the same `B1`. CLI: `gpu-prefactor <N> [B1] [curves] [B2]`.
- **Multi-GPU** batching: the curve batch is split across all visible devices and
  launched asynchronously (concurrent), degenerating to a single launch on a
  one-GPU box. Plus a **CMake target** (`misc/CMakeLists.txt`, built when
  `-DENABLE_GPU=ON`): `make gpu-prefactor`, installed to `<libdir>/misc`. The
  target forces device `-O3` (CADO sets no `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`, so default CUDA
  flags are unoptimized — a ~30× trap) and defaults to `sm_86`
  (`-DCADO_GPU_ARCH=` to override). The CMake build matches the standalone nvcc
  throughput (~550 curves/s, stage1+2, 512-bit on an RTX 3090).
- **`cado-nfs.py --gpu-prefactor`** integration (`scripts/cadofactor/gpu_prefactor.py`):
  runs the GPU stage before NFS, with `--gpu-b1/--gpu-b2/--gpu-curves`. If it
  fully factors N (cofactor 1 or prime), it prints the factorization and **skips
  NFS entirely**; if a composite cofactor remains, it finishes with a fresh
  `cado-nfs.py` on the cofactor (which selects parameters for the cofactor's
  size); if nothing is stripped or the GPU binary is absent, it falls through to
  a normal run. Only prime gcd-divisors are trusted (verified by Miller–Rabin).
  Validated: a 90-digit N (14-digit × 76-digit prime) was factored entirely by
  the GPU pre-stage in seconds, **product == N**, NFS skipped; normal runs
  without the flag are unaffected.
- **Staged-`B1` schedule** (`gpu-prefactor <N> staged [maxdigits] [scale]`):
  escalating `B1` (2000 → 11000 → 50000 → 250000 → 1e6 → 3e6) so small factors
  are found cheaply before spending curves at high `B1`; stops as soon as the
  cofactor is 1/prime. Reaches ~20–30-digit factors.
- **CPU-vs-GPU benchmark** (`bench/gpu-prefactor-bench.cu`): the *same* `ecm_run2`
  on the GPU vs the full 20-thread CPU (`std::thread`) — **49× / 25× / 11×** at
  128/256/512-bit on an RTX 3090 vs i9-10850K (the advantage shrinks at wider
  moduli as register/local-memory pressure lowers GPU occupancy — honest caveat).
  Recorded in `BENCHMARKS.md`. (Caught and fixed a dead-code-elimination trap: the
  CPU side needs an observable sink or the optimizer removes the whole ECM.)

## [3.0.0-modern] — 2026-06-05

Rebases the modernization effort onto upstream CADO-NFS **3.0.0** and adds four
tracks of rigorously-measured performance / robustness work. **No NFS
mathematics is changed** — every track is an implementation, build, or
orchestration optimization, and correctness (verified `product == N`
factorizations + `make check`) is the gate after each phase. Results are
reported honestly, including the parts that did *not* pay off.

Reference box for all measurements: **i9-10850K (10C/20T, Comet Lake → no
AVX-512) + RTX 3090 (Ampere, `sm_86`), 64 GiB, CachyOS.**

### Phase 0 — rebase onto upstream 3.0.0

- Builds cleanly on a current box (**CMake 4.x, GCC 16, C++20, Python 3.14**).
  3.0.0 already subsumes the 2.3.x portability fixes and brings, for free, the
  Bouvier–Imbert batch cofactorization (eprint 2018/669) and `I>16` sieving.
- The Flask/`requests` orchestration deps live in a venv
  (`scripts/setup-venv.sh`, pointed at by `local.sh`) rather than the system.
- Baseline established with a verified smoke factorization.

### Phase 1 — build & compiler (measured, not guessed)

- `bench/las-microbench.sh`: a deterministic siever microbenchmark (pinned c120
  polynomial + `las --random-sample N --seed S`, <1% CPU variance) that makes
  few-percent changes measurable despite the ~15–20% end-to-end polyselect noise.
- Result on the c120 siever workload (mean of 3, <1% variance):

  | flags | time | vs stock |
  |---|---|---|
  | stock `-O2` | 12.57 s | — |
  | `-O2 -march=native` | 11.79 s | −6.2% |
  | **`-O3 -march=native`** | **11.66 s** | **−7.2% (adopted)** |
  | `+LTO` | — | 0% (and breaks `-Werror`) → rejected |
  | `+PGO` | — | +2.8% (regresses) → rejected |

  `-march=native` (AVX2/BMI2/FMA host codegen) is the only real win; LTO and PGO
  are rejected on evidence. Final flags adopted in `local.sh`.

### Phase 2 — SIMD modernization

- **AVX2 on the siever: ruled out by profiling.** The hot path is scatter
  (`fill_in_buckets`, small-sieve) plus scalar modular arithmetic
  (`invmod_redc_32`, `plattice_info`), not vectorizable loops; the explicitly
  SSE2 survivor code is cold. Widening it would not move the needle.
- **AVX-512 VPCLMULQDQ gf2x base-case multiply** (the GF(2)[x] hot path used by
  `lingen`): `bench/vpclmul-mul1n.c` implements `mul_1_n`/`addmul_1_n` at four
  carryless multiplies per instruction (vs one per 128-bit `pclmul`), validated
  **bit-exact over 200 000 random trials under Intel SDE**
  (`bench/vpclmul-validate.sh`). `gf2x/already_tuned/x86_64_vpclmul/` carries the
  gf2x-integrated backend plus an `INTEGRATION.md` completion guide. Performance
  is gated on real AVX-512 silicon — the reference box is Comet Lake, so this is
  validated correct-only here.

### Phase 3 — GPU ECM cofactorization (RTX 3090) — validated, honest negative

- `bench/gpu-modmul-bench.cu`: batched 64-bit Montgomery modmul (ECM's inner
  primitive) — **~279 G modmul/s on the 3090 vs ~7.2 G across 20 CPU cores
  (~39×)**, correctness-checked.
- `bench/gpu-ecm.cu`: a complete batched ECM stage-1 (Montgomery-curve XZ ladder,
  on-device binary gcd). The same `__host__ __device__` code runs on CPU and GPU,
  so the GPU path is **bit-exact**; it cracks 256/256 test composites at
  ~2.75 M curves/s (B1=2000). Extended with Suyama-σ curves, a 128-bit Montgomery
  modulus (CIOS REDC), and a stage-2 BSGS continuation (+64% yield/curve).
- Integrated into CADO behind `facul`/`las-cofactor` with a CMake CUDA build and
  a live batched-drain hook (relations validated identical to the CPU path).
- **Honest conclusion (`docs/gpu-cofactorization.md`):** cofactorization is only
  ~8% of siever time (Amdahl ceiling), and a mid-effort "throughput win" turned
  out to be a correctness bug (a single-factor batch emitting relations with
  primes > `lpb`; fixed in `c675f82` with a complete-factorization check). With
  correctness enforced there is **no net single-machine speedup** from the GPU at
  these sizes — the value would be a cheaper-cofactorization *parameter-regime
  shift* on much larger inputs. Documented as a measured negative result rather
  than an unsubstantiated win.

### Phase 4 — Rust orchestration (robustness / scalability)

Ports the **network/DB substrate** of the distributed layer to async Rust while
keeping the **exact existing HTTP/JSON work-unit protocol**, so Rust binaries
interoperate with an unmodified `cado-nfs.py` during migration. This buys
robustness (no GIL, connection pooling, a single static client binary), not
single-machine factoring speed. Full details in `docs/rust-orchestration.md`.

- **`cado-nfs-client-rs`** (`rust/cado-nfs-client`, reqwest + rustls, no OpenSSL):
  the complete client loop — fetch work-unit, download + checksum-verify
  (sha1/256/3-256) inputs, run commands (argv split, no shell, exactly as the
  Python client), upload results. Plus failover across multiple `--server` URLs,
  TLS cert-pinning (`--certsha1`), `--niceness`, download `flock`, and `STDIN<n>`
  redirection (which the stock Python client never implemented).
- **`cado-wu-server-rs`** (`rust/cado-wu-server`, axum + tokio + bundled
  rusqlite): the five endpoints over the same `wudb` SQLite schema and status
  codes, replicating the `WuAccess` assign/result lifecycle, with stale-work
  timeout reassignment, `410`-after-finish, an r2d2/WAL connection pool, TLS
  (`--cert/--key`), and IP-whitelist enforcement (`--whitelist`, IPv4/IPv6
  exact + CIDR, matching `api_server.py`'s `api_limit_remote_addr`).
- **In-process swap:** `scripts/cadofactor/external_api_server.py` (`ExternalApiServer`)
  implements the `ApiServer` interface the driver uses by launching the Rust
  server over the same database; `cadotask.py` switches to it when
  `CADO_RUST_WU_SERVER` is set. TLS is wired (the shim regenerates the same
  self-signed cert and reports its SHA1 so clients pin it) and the whitelist is
  passed through.
- **`cadotask.py` is deliberately left in Python.** Phase 4's scope is the
  substrate, not the scheduler DAG; porting ~7.5K LOC of orchestration logic has
  no robustness/throughput payoff and a large correctness surface, so it stays
  behind the stable `ApiServer` seam.
- **Validation:** `rust/interop-test.sh` (Rust client ↔ stock Python server),
  `rust/server-interop-test.sh` (full lifecycle, Rust server + client),
  `rust/robustness-test.sh` (**13/13**), `rust/deploy-test.sh` (a real 59-digit
  factorization run entirely by external Rust clients), `rust/server-swap-test.sh`
  (Rust server swapped into a live `cado-nfs.py` run, plain HTTP) and
  `rust/server-swap-tls-test.sh` (the same over TLS with cert-pinning + whitelist).

### Net finding

CPU-side tuning is nearly tapped out on this hand-optimized codebase (Phase 1
~7%, Phase 2 AVX2 nil). The structural headroom is in *new compute resources* —
the GPU (validated ~39× on the modmul primitive, though Amdahl-bounded at these
sizes) and, where available, AVX-512 VPCLMULQDQ (validated correct) — and in the
Rust orchestration substrate for multi-client robustness.

### Versioning

- `CADO_VERSION_STRING` is `3.0.0-modern` (`CMakeLists.txt`); the numeric
  components stay at upstream 3.0.0, only the display string is suffixed. No test
  depends on the version string.

## [2.3.1-modern] — 2026-06-04

First release of the modernization fork. Upstream CADO-NFS 2.3.0 (2017) does
not build or run unmodified on a current toolchain. This release makes the
2.3.0 codebase build cleanly and factor numbers end-to-end on
**CMake 4.x, GCC 16, hwloc 2.x, OpenSSL 3.x, and Python 3.14**, with no change
to the underlying algorithms.

### Build system

- **CMake 4.x compatibility.** CMake 4 removed compatibility with policies
  below 3.5, but CADO-NFS declares `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.11)`.
  `local.sh` now passes `-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5` via
  `CMAKE_EXTRA_ARGS` so configuration succeeds. (Harmless on older CMake.)
- **GCC 10+ `-fno-common`.** Modern GCC defaults to `-fno-common`, turning the
  project's tentative global definitions (e.g. `bw` in `linalg/bwc`) into
  multiple-definition link errors. `local.sh` now sets `CFLAGS="-O2 -fcommon"`.
- **gf2x ISO C90 generator.** `gf2x/lowlevel/gen_bb_mul_code.c` is compiled by
  gf2x's *build-system* compiler in ISO C90, where `//` comments are illegal.
  One dead-code `//` comment was converted to `/* … */`.
- **Version bumped** `2.3.0` → `2.3.1` (`CMakeLists.txt`).
- `local.sh` is now committed (it carries only portable, machine-independent
  build flags) so the tree builds out-of-the-box.

### C/C++

- **hwloc 1.x → 2.x port** in `linalg/bwc/cpubinding.cpp`. The removed
  `HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IO_DEVICES` / `HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IO_BRIDGES` topology
  flags are replaced by `hwloc_topology_set_io_types_filter(topology,
  HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_NONE)`, version-guarded with
  `#if HWLOC_API_VERSION >= 0x00020000` so hwloc 1.x still compiles. Behaviour
  is preserved: I/O devices are excluded from the topology, which is also the
  hwloc-2.x default.

### Python orchestration (`scripts/cadofactor/`, `cado-nfs-client.py`)

- **`fractions.gcd` → `math.gcd`** (`cadotask.py`); `fractions.gcd` was removed
  in Python 3.9. Guarded with a fallback import for very old Pythons.
- **`collections.*` ABCs → `collections.abc.*`** (`wudb.py`); the
  `collections.MutableMapping` / `Mapping` / `Container` aliases were removed in
  Python 3.10.
- **HTTPS work-unit server** (`wuserver.py`):
  - Server certificate key size raised 1024 → 2048 bits; OpenSSL 3.x rejects
    keys below 2048 (`EE_KEY_TOO_SMALL`).
  - `ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23` → `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER` (the former is deprecated).
  - Added `FixedHTTPServer.handle_error` to swallow the benign
    connection-teardown from the client's certificate-download probe, which
    previously printed an alarming (but harmless) `BrokenPipeError` traceback.
- **HTTPS work-unit client** (`cado-nfs-client.py`):
  - `urllib.request.urlopen(..., cafile=…)` → `urlopen(..., context=
    ssl.create_default_context(cafile=…))`; the `cafile`/`capath`/`cadefault`
    parameters were removed from `urlopen()` in Python 3.12. This was the
    failure that left clients unable to fetch work units and the run hung.
  - The `NO_CN_CHECK` setting (skip hostname verification) is now honoured on
    Python 3 instead of raising "not implemented".

### Verification

- Full build completes (100%, exit 0) on the reference machine
  (CachyOS, GCC 16.1.1, GMP 6.3.0, hwloc 2.13.0, OpenSSL 3.x, Python 3.14.5).
- A 59-digit demo factorization
  (`90377629292003121684002147101760858109247336549001090677693`) completes in
  ~30 s **over HTTPS**, producing four 15-digit primes whose product equals the
  input; the Linear-Algebra (Block-Wiedemann) phase exercises the ported
  `cpubinding.cpp`.
- Targeted unit-test subsets (`test_bitlinalg*`, `sievetest*`) pass.

### Not changed

- No algorithmic, numerical, or parameter changes — this fork is a portability
  layer only.
- Upstream source style is preserved; no bulk reformatting.
- Multi-machine/distributed mode is unchanged in spirit; only the shared SSL
  layer was modernized (now exercised successfully on localhost over HTTPS).

[2.3.1-modern]: https://github.com/doublegate/cado-nfs-2.3.1-modern/releases/tag/v2.3.1-modern
