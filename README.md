# CADO-NFS 2.3.1-modern

A **modernization fork** of [CADO-NFS](https://gitlab.inria.fr/cado-nfs/cado-nfs)
2.3.0 — a complete implementation in C / C++ / Python of the **Number Field
Sieve (NFS)** algorithm for integer factorization and discrete logarithms in
finite fields.

> **What this fork is.** Upstream CADO-NFS 2.3.0 was released in 2017 and does
> not build or run unmodified on a current toolchain. This fork applies a thin
> portability layer so the 2.3.0 codebase builds cleanly and factors numbers
> end-to-end on **CMake 4.x, GCC 16, hwloc 2.x, OpenSSL 3.x, and Python 3.14** —
> with **no changes to the algorithms, numerics, or parameters**. See
> [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the exact patch list.
>
> This is **not** the official CADO-NFS. For releases, ongoing development, and
> support, use the upstream project (links below).

## Quick start

### Dependencies

- A C/C++ compiler (GCC ≥ 4.7 or compatible Clang; tested through GCC 16)
- [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) ≥ 5, **built with `--enable-shared`**
- CMake (any 2.8.11+; CMake 4.x works via the bundled `local.sh` flag)
- Python 3 with the `sqlite3` module
- Optional: `hwloc` (CPU pinning), MPI, `curl`

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libgmp-dev libhwloc-dev python3
```

### Build

```bash
make            # out-of-tree build into build/<hostname>/
make check      # run the test suite (ctest); use ARGS="-R <regex>" to filter
```

The portable modern-toolchain flags live in the committed
[`local.sh`](local.sh) (`-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5` for CMake 4 and
`-fcommon` for GCC 10+). Edit `local.sh` then `make cmake` to reconfigure.

### Factor a number

```bash
./cado-nfs.py 90377629292003121684002147101760858109247336549001090677693 -t 4
```

This runs the full pipeline (polynomial selection → sieving → filtering →
linear algebra → square root) over a local HTTPS work-unit server and prints
the prime factors. On a modern desktop the 59-digit demo finishes in ~30 s.
CADO-NFS targets numbers **> 85 digits**; **< 60 digits is unsupported**, and
you should strip small factors first.

> **CLI note:** `key=value` parameters must come *before* flags like `-t`
> (e.g. `./cado-nfs.py <N> server.ssl=no -t 4`). Pass `server.ssl=no` to use
> plain HTTP instead of TLS (optional).

parameter documentation, see the upstream guides preserved in this tree:
[`README`](README), [`README.dlp`](README.dlp), and [`README.Python`](README.Python).

## Performance

Reference timings factoring balanced (RSA-like) semiprimes on an
**Intel i9-10850K (10 cores / 20 threads), 64 GiB RAM, CachyOS**, GMP 6.3.0,
all 20 threads. Every result was verified (factors multiply back to the input
and are prime).

| Digits | Bits | Wall time | CADO CPU | Parallel speedup |
|-------:|-----:|----------:|---------:|-----------------:|
| 60 | ~199 | 30.6 s | 57.8 s | 1.9× |
| 70 | ~232 | 35.4 s | 121.8 s | 3.5× |
| 80 | ~265 | 73.9 s | 558.0 s | 7.6× |
| 90 | ~299 | 175.3 s | 1942.7 s | 11.1× |

Per-phase CPU (seconds), showing where the work goes:

| Digits | Lattice sieving | Filtering | Linear algebra | Square root |
|-------:|----------------:|----------:|---------------:|------------:|
| 60 | 39.4 | 20.9 | 3.7 | 0.7 |
| 80 | 342.2 | 44.0 | 39.1 | 5.1 |
| 90 | 1409.7 | 130.6 | 366.2 | 31.7 |

**Key findings**

- **Sieving dominates** (61-73 % of CPU) and is the embarrassingly-parallel
  phase, so **parallel efficiency rises with size** (1.9×→11.1×): at small sizes
  fixed sequential overhead swamps the tiny sieve; at c90 the 20 threads stay
  busy.
- **Linear algebra grows the fastest** of any phase (~100× from c60 to c90 vs
  ~36× for sieving) and is the emerging second bottleneck — the classic NFS
  trade-off.
- **Wall-time roughly doubles per +10 digits** (CPU work grows 3.5-4.6×),
  consistent with the sub-exponential `L(1/3)` complexity of NFS.
- **Practical envelope on this desktop:** ≤c75 interactive (< 1 min) · c80-c95 a
  few minutes · ~c100 ≈ 10-15 min · ~c110 ≈ 1 hr · c120 overnight · ≥c130 wants
  distributed mode. Comfortable single-session ceiling ≈ **c105-c110**.

## What changed in this fork

| Area | Change | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Build | `local.sh`: `CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5`, `-fcommon` | CMake 4.x dropped pre-3.5 policies; GCC 10+ defaults to `-fno-common` |
| Build | `gf2x/lowlevel/gen_bb_mul_code.c`: `//` → `/* */` | gf2x build compiler runs ISO C90 |
| C++ | `linalg/bwc/cpubinding.cpp`: hwloc 1.x → 2.x API | hwloc 2.0 removed the I/O topology flags |
| Python | `math.gcd`, `collections.abc.*` | removed from stdlib in 3.9 / 3.10 |
| Python | TLS server/client modernized (2048-bit cert, `PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER`, `urlopen(context=)`) | OpenSSL 3.x + `urlopen(cafile=)` removed in 3.12 |

modernization record.

## How it works

Two companion explainers of the Number Field Sieve, depending on your background:

- **Plain English, no math** — [`docs/number-field-sieve-plain-english.md`](docs/number-field-sieve-plain-english.md):
  a friendly, analogy-driven tour for any curious reader (why factoring is hard,
  what the program does, and why it matters for online security).
- **The mathematics** — [`docs/number-field-sieve.md`](docs/number-field-sieve.md):
  the rigorous version — congruence of squares, the two-polynomial number-field
  construction, smoothness and sieving, the $\mathbb{F}_2$ linear algebra, the
  algebraic square root, complexity, and how each phase maps to the directories
  in this tree.
