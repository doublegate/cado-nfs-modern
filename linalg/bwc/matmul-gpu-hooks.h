/* Cross-TU hooks for keeping BWC vectors device-resident across the comm
 * (v3.1.0-modern, Track 2.2 — comm-on-device, the full-vector-residency win).
 *
 * The BWC comm (mmt_vec_allreduce, in matmul_top_comm.cpp, part of bwc_base)
 * lives in a CUDA-free translation unit. The GPU matmul backend (matmul-gpu.cu)
 * installs the function pointers below in its constructor; bwc_base calls them
 * through the pointers, so the comm can run the GF(2) reduce/broadcast directly
 * on the device-resident sibling vectors instead of bouncing through host memory
 * every iteration. When no GPU backend is loaded the pointers stay null and the
 * comm takes its ordinary host path — zero behavioural change. The whole device
 * path is additionally gated at the call site on CADO_GPU_VECRESIDENT and on the
 * single-node case (no MPI); see matmul_top_comm.cpp. */
