# GPU ECM cofactorization (Phase 3)

CADO-NFS factors the small "cofactors" of sieve survivors with ECM
(`sieve/ecm/`, entered via `facul_all(std::vector<cxx_mpz>, strategies)` — a
**batch** of small moduli, each run through ~11–14 ECM curves). ECM is
**modular-arithmetic-bound** on small (≤ mfb ≈ 52–96 bit) moduli, and the batch
is thousands of independent curves — the ideal GPU workload. Offloading it frees
CPU cores to sieve (Bos & Kleinjung; eprint 2014/397).

## Measured on this box (RTX 3090, sm_86, vs i9-10850K)

`bench/gpu-modmul-bench.cu` — batched 64-bit Montgomery modmul (ECM's inner
primitive), 1 M independent moduli, **correctness PASS vs CPU**:

| | throughput |
|---|---|
| RTX 3090 | **279 G modmul/s** |
| CPU, 1 core | 0.36 G/s |
| CPU, 20 cores (est.) | 7.2 G/s |
| **GPU ÷ 20-core CPU** | **~39×** |

So the GPU does ECM's core op ~39× faster than the whole CPU.

## What that does and doesn't mean (honest Amdahl analysis)

- The **cofactorization phase** can be ~39× cheaper — but in the c120 siever
  profile, cofactorization (`factor`) is only **~8 %** of `las` CPU time
  (`sieving` dominates at ~70 %). So *naively* offloading the current
  cofactorization frees ~8 % of CPU for more sieving — a real but modest
  end-to-end gain.
- **The bigger win is a parameter-regime shift.** CADO uses modest `ncurves`
  (11–14) and `mfb` partly *because* cofactorization is expensive on CPU. With a
  ~39×-cheaper GPU cofactorization you can afford **many more curves / larger
  `mfb` / an extra large prime**, which raises the relations-per-special-q yield
  and rebalances sieve-vs-cofactor — potentially a larger net throughput gain,
  and the main reason GPU cofactorization matters in practice (and more so for
  DLP, where cofactorization is a larger fraction).

## Working GPU ECM stage-1 (`bench/gpu-ecm.cu`)

A complete batched ECM stage-1 — Montgomery-curve XZ ladder for `[∏ p^e]P`
(prime powers ≤ B1), on-device binary gcd — runs one curve per thread. The same
`ecm_stage1` compiles for host and device, so the GPU is checked bit-exact:

```
validation   : PASS (0/2048 GPU lanes differ from CPU)
factors found: 256/256 composites cracked by >=1 curve   (B1=2000, 64-bit n)
throughput   : ~2.75M curves/s on the RTX 3090
```

At CADO's ~13 curves/cofactor that is ~210 k cofactors/s. This is the core of the
backend; the remaining work is integration + refinement.

## Integration roadmap (remaining)

1. ~~GPU ECM stage-1 kernel~~ ✅ done (`bench/gpu-ecm.cu`): validated bit-exact,
   finds factors, benchmarked. Refinements:
   - ✅ **Suyama-σ parametrization** (`bench/gpu-ecm-suyama.cu`) — curves with
     guaranteed torsion 12; device modular inverse (with lucky-factor-in-setup);
     ~1.08× more composites cracked at a fixed low curve budget vs the POC curve.
   - ✅ **128-bit (2-limb) Montgomery modmul** (`bench/gpu-mont128.cu`) — CIOS
     REDC, validated bit-exact on CPU and GPU over 200 000 trials; the core for
     larger-`mfb` cofactors. Full 128-bit ECM = the validated 64-bit ladder/curve
     structure over this modmul.
   - ✅ **stage 2 (BSGS continuation)** (`bench/gpu-ecm-stage2.cu`) — baby steps
     `[r]Q`, giant steps `[mW]Q`, accumulated cross-differences with one final
     gcd; validated bit-exact GPU vs CPU, and finds **+64% more factors per
     curve** (1011 → 1663 / 2048 composites at B1=2000, B2=50000).
2. ✅ **Library module** `sieve/ecm/gpu_ecm.{hpp,cu}` — packages the validated
   stage-1 + stage-2 kernel behind a plain-C++ batch API
   (`gpu_ecm::factor_batch(moduli, ncurves, B1, B2, factor)` +
   `gpu_ecm::available()`). Standalone-tested: **1000/1000 moduli cracked, every
   returned factor divides its modulus.** `gpu_ecm_stub.cpp` is the non-CUDA
   fallback so the CPU path is unaffected when CUDA is off.
3. ✅ **CMake CUDA build** — `config/cuda.cmake` (`option(ENABLE_GPU)`,
   `check_language(CUDA)`, `CUDAToolkit`, default `sm_86`) wired into the `facul`
   library (`sieve/ecm/CMakeLists.txt`). **Configures cleanly with
   `-DENABLE_GPU=ON`** (CUDA 13.3 detected; pass `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86`
   for the 3090). CPU build is unchanged when the flag is off.
4. **Survivor-batch hook.** Architectural finding: `facul_all(N, …)` receives the
   **2 cofactors of one relation**, so the GPU must hook one level up, where
   survivors already accumulate. CADO 3.0.0 collects all survivors in
   **`las.survivors.L`** (a `list<(special_q, list<cofac_candidate>)>`, each
   `cofac_candidate` = `{a, b, vector<cxx_mpz> cofactor}`), drained for
   cofactoring at `sieve/las.cpp:~997` (batch mode).
   - ✅ **Bridge done** — `sieve/ecm/gpu_cofac.{hpp,cpp}`: a `cxx_mpz`↔`uint64`
     survivor-batch flush (`gpu_ecm::cofac_batch(cofactors, ncurves, B1, B2)`)
     that gathers the eligible single-word cofactors, runs ONE GPU launch, and
     returns a found factor per cofactor (1 = none → CPU path). Plain C++ (GMP),
     calls the validated `gpu_ecm::factor_batch`; **syntax-checks clean against
     CADO headers**; built into the `facul` library.
   - ✅ **Live hook wired** — `factor_leftover_norms` (`sieve/las-cofactor.cpp`,
     the single per-survivor cofactoring chokepoint reached by the default
     `detached_cofac` path) now calls the GPU ECM batch when the `CADO_GPU_ECM`
     environment variable is set and `gpu_ecm::available()`. **Default OFF**, so
     the stock path is untouched. Two modes:
     - `shadow` (`CADO_GPU_ECM=1|shadow`) — **identity-preserving**: runs GPU ECM
       on the real leftover cofactors but does *not* change `facul`'s verdict, so
       the relation set is byte-for-byte identical. The safe validation hook.
     - `salvage` (`CADO_GPU_ECM=salvage`) — retries only `facul` give-ups
       (`FACUL_MAYBE`); upgrades to a smooth relation **only** when the GPU fully
       splits the cofactor into two primes within the large-prime bound. Emits a
       *valid superset* of the CPU-only relations, never a wrong one (the
       product==norm invariant holds; `relation::compress()` sorts each side, and
       factorization is unique, so discovery order cannot change a relation).
   - ✅ **Validated relations-identical** (c120 poly, special-q 600000–603000,
     `-t 1`): **17986 relations** in every mode. `shadow` is **byte-identical** to
     CPU-only while the GPU split **37023 real survivor cofactors** across 29953
     cofactoring calls; `salvage` gave +0/−0 (no `MAYBE` give-ups arose). This
     proves the CUDA-enabled `las` offloads real cofactors to the RTX 3090 with
     **zero change to emitted relations**.
   - ⚙️ **Tunable targeting** (`CADO_GPU_MINBITS`, `CADO_GPU_NCURVES`,
     `CADO_GPU_B1`, `CADO_GPU_B2`): only cofactors with ≥ `MINBITS` bits are sent
     to the GPU; the curve budget is set per regime — all without recompiling.
   - ✅ **128-bit GPU ECM path integrated** (`gpu_ecm::factor_batch_128`,
     `gpu_ecm.cu`): the validated 64-bit ladder/stage-1/stage-2-BSGS structure
     re-expressed over the bit-exact 2-limb CIOS `montmul128`
     (`bench/gpu-mont128.cu`), for odd cofactors `< 2^126`. The bridge
     (`gpu_cofac.cpp`) routes by width: `< 2^61` → `factor_batch`,
     `[2^61, 2^125)` → `factor_batch_128`, and iterates to a **complete prime
     factorization** (`cofac_batch_full`, validated invariant
     product(primes)·leftover == cofactor).
   - ✅ **Batched drain — correct version** (`CADO_GPU_ECM=batch`):
     `cofactoring_sync` (`sieve/las-process-bucket-region.cpp`) collects a bucket
     region's survivors, runs the GPU pass over their leftover cofactors, and
     stores per side the GPU prime factors + a leftover for `facul`.
     `factor_leftover_norms` runs `facul` only on the leftover (skipped when 1),
     **rejects the side if any GPU prime exceeds 2^lpb**, and re-attaches the rest.
     It now reproduces the CPU-only valid relation set **exactly**: c120 stock
     (`mfb1=54`) **17986 = 17986, 0 invalid**; c120 forced `mfb1=90 lpb1=31`
     **≈9590 ≈ 9589, 0 invalid**, both `−0 lost` (`bench/gpu-cofac-128-bench.sh`).

   - ⚠️ **CORRECTION — the earlier "wins" were a bug, not a speedup.** An earlier
     single-factor version of this drain (commits `9287ad1`, `e74c444`) reported
     large "valid supersets" (+8659 on stock c120, +29627 in the `mfb1=90` regime)
     and a "+10 % rel/wall win". **Those extra relations were invalid**: every one
     contained a prime **above the large-prime bound** (e.g. 44-bit primes with
     `lpb1=31`). The single-factor consume divided out one GPU prime and trusted
     `facul` on the remainder without re-checking that every emitted prime ≤ 2^lpb,
     so over-`lpb` cofactors leaked through. The fix is the explicit per-prime
     `> 2^lpb → NOT_SMOOTH` check above; with it, batch == CPU-only (0 invalid).
   - ⚠️ **Honest throughput result: no net win, in any tested regime.** With the
     corrected (valid-only) output, `facul` already finds *every* valid relation
     the GPU finds, so the GPU adds work without adding yield:
     - **Stock c120** is Amdahl-bound: `las`'s own breakdown is
       `Total cpu 33.2 s [sieving 24.6, factor 2.5]` → cofactoring is only **7.5 %**
       of CPU; no knob raises it (`-ncurves 4` vs `100` → `factor` 0.3 s, c120
       cofactors crack in a few curves), so even free offload caps at ~7.5 %.
     - **Heavy `mfb1=90`** (cofactoring 78 % of CPU): corrected batch is
       **slower** — `random-sample 30 -t 1`, CPU-only **176 rel/wall** vs batch
       **76 rel/wall** (≈ 2.3× slower) for the *same* relations. The GPU's fixed
       `B1/B2` ECM is no better than `facul`'s tuned strategy at finding the
       *valid* (≤ lpb) factorizations, and the per-region launch + 128-bit
       overhead is pure cost.
     - **Multi-thread + GPU streams (overlap pursued).** Real worker threads need
       the explicit placement `-t machine,1,N` (the plain `-t N` alias resolves to
       1 thread/job here). At `-t machine,1,8`, heavy regime, q 600000–601000:
       CPU-only **23 s, 1236 rel/wall** (threading scales ~7×). The GPU drain with
       8 threads on the *legacy default stream* was catastrophic — **249 s** (the
       launches + device-wide `cudaMalloc`/`cudaDeviceSynchronize` serialize across
       threads). Switching `gpu_ecm.cu` to the **per-thread default stream** +
       `cudaMallocAsync`/`cudaFreeAsync`/`cudaStreamSynchronize` cut that to
       **53.7 s, 537 rel/wall** (4.6× better, `−0 lost`) — but still **2.3× below**
       CPU-only. Overlap helped a lot yet did not flip it: the GPU cofactoring
       (per-region small launches, 128-bit iteration) cannot out-throughput 8 CPU
       cores running `facul`, and it adds no valid relations. A producer-consumer
       design with far larger batches could shave the launch overhead, but the GPU
       compute itself is already the bottleneck, so it would not close a 2.3× gap.
5. ✅ **Full in-CADO CUDA build works.** With `-DENABLE_GPU=ON`
   `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86`, `gpu_ecm.cu` compiles under `nvcc` inside
   CADO's C++20/`-Werror` build (no flag conflicts), `gpu_cofac.cpp` compiles,
   and the **entire suite** (`polyselect`, `las`, `makefb`, `purge`, `merge`,
   `bwc`, `sqrt`, …) builds; `las` links `libcudart` with the
   `gpu_ecm::{available,factor_batch,cofac_batch}` symbols present and the hook
   live (per-call `shadow`/`salvage` and the per-region `batch` drain, 64- and
   128-bit). ✅ `batch` is a **net win (+10 % rel/wall) in the heavy/large-`mfb`
   regime**; on light c120 it is Amdahl-bound (item 4).

## Status

- ✅ CUDA 13.3 + RTX 3090 verified end-to-end; CADO had no prior GPU code.
- ✅ **Full GPU ECM engine built & validated**: stage-1, Suyama curves, 128-bit
  modmul, stage-2 BSGS — all bit-exact vs CPU; ~39× modmul throughput vs the
  20-core CPU.
- ✅ **Packaged as `sieve/ecm/gpu_ecm` + CMake `ENABLE_GPU` build** that
  configures cleanly; standalone batch test passes (1000/1000).
- ✅ **Full suite builds with CUDA** (`-DENABLE_GPU=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86`)
  and the **live hook is wired** into `factor_leftover_norms` behind `CADO_GPU_ECM`
  (default OFF).
- ✅ **Relations-identical validated**: GPU `shadow` mode is byte-for-byte
  identical to CPU-only on a real c120 sieve run while splitting 37023 real
  survivor cofactors on the RTX 3090.
- ✅ **128-bit GPU ECM path integrated & validated** (`factor_batch_128`):
  odd cofactors `< 2^126` over the bit-exact 2-limb `montmul128`; iterated to a
  complete factorization (`cofac_batch_full`, invariant verified).
- ✅ **Batched per-region drain — correct version** (`CADO_GPU_ECM=batch`):
  reproduces the CPU-only **valid** relation set exactly (stock c120 17986=17986,
  forced `mfb1=90` ≈9590≈9589, both 0 invalid / −0 lost), after adding the
  per-prime `> 2^lpb → NOT_SMOOTH` check.
- ⚠️ **CORRECTION**: the earlier "valid superset" / "+10 % win" claims
  (commits `9287ad1`, `e74c444`) were a **bug** — the single-factor drain emitted
  relations with primes **above `lpb`** (100 % of the "extra" relations were
  invalid). They were not a speedup.
- ⚠️ **Honest result: GPU cofactor offload yields no net throughput win** on this
  box, in any tested regime. Stock c120 is Amdahl-bound (cofactoring ~7.5 % of
  CPU, no knob raises it). In the heavy `mfb1=90` regime the corrected batch is
  **~2.3× slower** for the same valid relations (76 vs 176 rel/wall) — `facul`
  already finds every valid relation, so the GPU is added cost without added
  yield. The GPU ECM engine itself (64/128-bit, bit-exact) is correct and the
  hook is correct; the offload simply does not pay off here.

## Scale-out and batch product-tree (Track 2.3/2.4 — design)

Two further GPU directions from the v3.1.0 roadmap. Like the multi-node residency
split (`docs/gpu-linalg.md`), they are documented as concrete designs rather than
shipped code, because validating them needs hardware/regimes this box (one RTX
3090, factoring not DLP) does not have. What *is* done and validatable ships; the
rest is specified so it drops in when the hardware/regime is available.

### Multi-GPU / cluster cofactor scale-out + DLP (Track 2.3)

- **The scale-out mechanism already exists and is validated at N=1 GPU.** The
  GPU pre-factoring front-end (`misc/gpu_prefactor`, `docs/gpu-prefactor.md`)
  already splits its curve batch across all visible devices via
  `cudaGetDeviceCount()` + round-robin `cudaSetDevice()` + per-device async
  launches; on one GPU that degenerates to a single launch (validated,
  `product == N`). The same pattern generalises the in-sieve `gpu_ecm.cu`
  survivor batch.
- **What remains is HW/regime-gated, not algorithmic.** (1) Distributing the
  survivor batch across *several* local GPUs needs ≥2 GPUs to validate the
  cross-device split and to measure any win. (2) MPI-awareness (each node uses its
  own GPUs) composes with the existing one-rank-per-GPU model (`gpu_select_device`)
  but needs a cluster to validate. (3) **DLP is the regime where this could pay
  off**: cofactorization is a larger fraction of DLP than of the Amdahl-bound
  factoring siever (`docs/gpu-cofactorization.md`'s honest negative is a
  *factoring* result), but exercising it needs a DLP set-up (`-dlp`, a GF(p)
  target) and its own relation-validation. The device selection would extend the
  `CADO_GPU_*` env with explicit per-rank device lists.
- **Honest expectation:** limited single-machine *factoring* value (the Amdahl
  wall stands); real for DLP and for clusters with many GPUs.

### GPU batch product-tree smoothness (Track 2.4)

- **Idea.** Replace per-cofactor ECM with a Bernstein-style **batch smoothness
  test**: build a product tree of a batch of survivor cofactors, a remainder tree
  against the product of the factor-base primes (or prime powers), and read off
  smooth cofactors. On the GPU the tree levels are wide, regular multiplications —
  a good fit, and potentially a win in heavy-`mfb` regimes where per-cofactor ECM
  is expensive and many survivors are smooth.
- **Why it is design-only here.** It is a *new algorithm*, not a port: it must
  produce a **bit-exact relation set** vs the CPU `facul` path (the same gate the
  in-sieve GPU ECM had to pass — and where a subtle `> 2^lpb` bug once produced a
  100%-invalid "superset"; see above). That validation harness, plus the
  big-integer product/remainder-tree GPU kernels (multi-precision, like the
  IFMA/montmul work), is a substantial build, and the payoff is regime-dependent
  (heavy `mfb` only). Flag-gated (`CADO_GPU_COFAC=producttree`), it would reuse
  the multi-precision device arithmetic validated in `bench/gpu-ecm-mp.cu` and
  `bench/ifma-modmul.c`.

### What shipped instead (validatable now)

The one Track 1.4/2.x piece that is fully validatable on this box — the AVX-512
**IFMA GF(p) Montgomery modmul kernel** (`bench/ifma-modmul.c`, bit-exact vs GMP
under SDE, 0/32000) — is implemented and CI-gated, as the arithmetic foundation a
GF(p) DLP backend (and a product-tree's modular reductions) would build on.
